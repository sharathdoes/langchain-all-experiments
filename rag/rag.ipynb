SHEPPARD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE\\nMrs. Ferrars died on the night of the 16th–17th September—a Thursday. I\\nwas sent for at eight o’clock on the morning of Friday the 17th. There was\\nnothing to be done. She had been dead some hours.\\nIt was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I\\nopened the front door with my latchkey, and purposely delayed a few\\nmoments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that I had\\ndeemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn morning. To\\ntell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am not going to\\npretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the next few weeks. I\\nemphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me that there were stirring\\ntimes ahead.\\nFrom the dining room on my left there came the rattle of teacups and\\nthe short, dry cough of my sister Caroline.\\n“Is that you, James?” she called.\\nAn unnecessary question, since who else could it be? To tell the truth, it\\nwas precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few minutes’\\ndelay. The motto of the mongoose family, so Mr. Kipling tells us, is: “Go\\nand find out.” If Caroline ever adopts a crest, I should certainly suggest a\\nmongoose rampant. One might omit the first part of the motto. Caroline can\\ndo any amount of finding out by sitting placidly at home. I don’t know how\\nshe manages it, but there it is. I suspect that the servants and the tradesmen\\nconstitute her Intelligence Corps. When she goes out, it is not to gather in\\ninformation, but to spread it. At that, too, she is amazingly expert.\\nIt was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these\\npangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise\\nof Mrs. Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within the\\nspace of an hour and a half. As a professional man, I naturally aim at\\ndiscretion. Therefore I have got into the habit of continually withholding all\\ninformation possible from my sister. She usually finds out just the same, but\\nI have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I am in no way to blame.\\nMrs. Ferrars’ husband died just over a year ago, and Caroline has\\nconstantly asserted, without the least foundation for the assertion, that his\\nwife poisoned him.\\nShe scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr. Ferrars died of acute\\ngastritis, helped on by habitual overindulgence in alcoholic beverages. The\\nsymptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not, I agree, unlike, but\\nCaroline bases her accusation on quite different lines.\\n“You’ve only got to look at her,” I have heard her say.\\nMrs. Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was a very attractive woman,\\nand her clothes, though simple, always seemed to fit her very well, but all\\nthe same, lots of women buy their clothes in Paris, and have not, on that\\naccount, necessarily poisoned their husbands.\\nAs I stood hesitating in the hall, with all this passing through my mind,\\nCaroline’s voice came again, with a sharper note in it.\\n“What on earth are you doing out there, James? Why don’t you come\\nand get your breakfast?”\\n“Just coming, my dear,” I said hastily. “I’ve been hanging up my\\novercoat.”\\n“You could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.”\\nShe was quite right. I could have.\\nI walked into the dining room, gave Caroline the accustomed peck on\\nthe cheek, and sat down to eggs and bacon. The bacon was rather cold.\\n“You’ve had an early call,” remarked Caroline.\\n“Yes,” I said. “King’s Paddock. Mrs. Ferrars.”\\n“I know,” said my sister.\\n“How did you know?”\\n“Annie told me.”\\nAnnie is the house parlourmaid. A nice girl, but an inveterate talker.\\nThere was a pause. I continued to eat eggs and bacon. My sister’s nose,\\nwhich is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does when\\nshe is interested or excited over anything.\\n“Well?” she demanded.\\n“A sad business. Nothing to be done. Must have died in her sleep.”\\n“I know,” said my sister again.\\nThis time I was annoyed.\\n“You can’t know,” I snapped. “I didn’t know myself until I got there,\\nand haven’t mentioned it to a soul yet. If that girl Annie knows, she must be\\na clairvoyant.”\\n“It wasn’t Annie who told me. It was the milkman. He had it from the\\nFerrarses’ cook.”\\nAs I say, there is no need for Caroline to go out to get information. She\\nsits at home and it comes to her.\\nMy sister continued:\\n“What did she die of? Heart failure?”\\n“Didn’t the milkman tell you that?” I inquired sarcastically.\\nSarcasm is wasted on Caroline. She takes it seriously and answers\\naccordingly.\\n“He didn’t know,” she explained.\\nAfter all, Caroline was bound to hear sooner or later. She might as well\\nhear from me.\\n“She died of an overdose of Veronal. She’s been taking it lately for\\nsleeplessness. Must have taken too much.”\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline immediately. “She took it on purpose. Don’t\\ntell me!”\\nIt is odd, when you have a secret belief of your own which you do not\\nwish to acknowledge, the voicing of it by someone else will rouse you to a\\nfury of denial. I burst immediately into indignant speech.\\n“There you go again,” I said. “Rushing along without rhyme or reason.\\nWhy on earth should Mrs. Ferrars wish to commit suicide? A widow, fairly\\nyoung still, very well off, good health, and nothing to do but enjoy life. It’s\\nabsurd.”\\n“Not at all. Even you must have noticed how different she has been\\nlooking lately. It’s been coming on for the last six months. She’s looked\\npositively hag-ridden. And you have just admitted that she hasn’t been able\\nto sleep.”\\n“What is your diagnosis?” I demanded coldly. “An unfortunate love\\naffair, I suppose?”\\nMy sister shook her head.\\n“Remorse,” she said, with great gusto.\\n“Remorse?”\\n“Yes. You never would believe me when I told you she poisoned her\\nhusband. I’m more than ever convinced of it now.”\\n“I don’t think you’re very logical,” I objected. “Surely if a woman\\ncommitted a crime like murder, she’d be sufficiently cold-blooded to enjoy\\nthe fruits of it without any weak-minded sentimentality such as repentance.”\\nCaroline shook her head.\\n“There probably are women like that—but Mrs. Ferrars wasn’t one of\\nthem. She was a mass of nerves. An overmastering impulse drove her on to\\nget rid of her husband because she was the sort of person who simply can’t\\nendure suffering of any kind, and there’s no doubt that the wife of a man\\nlike Ashley Ferrars must have had to suffer a good deal—”\\nI nodded.\\n“And ever since she’s been haunted by what she did. I can’t help feeling\\nsorry for her.”\\nI don’t think Caroline ever felt sorry for Mrs. Ferrars whilst she was\\nalive. Now that she has gone where (presumably) Paris frocks can no longer\\nbe worn, Caroline is prepared to indulge in the softer emotions of pity and\\ncomprehension.\\nI told her firmly that her whole idea was nonsense. I was all the more\\nfirm because I secretly agreed with some part, at least, of what she had said.\\nBut it is all wrong that Caroline should arrive at the truth simply by a kind\\nof inspired guesswork. I wasn’t going to encourage that sort of thing. She\\nwill go round the village airing her views, and everyone will think that she\\nis doing so on medical data supplied by me. Life is very trying.\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline, in reply to my strictures. “You’ll see. Ten to\\none she’s left a letter confessing everything.”\\n“She didn’t leave a letter of any kind,” I said sharply, and not seeing\\nwhere the admission was going to land me.\\n“Oh!” said Caroline. “So you did inquire about that, did you? I believe,\\nJames, that in your heart of hearts, you think very much as I do. You’re a\\nprecious old humbug.”\\n“One always has to take the possibility of suicide into consideration,” I\\nsaid impressively.\\n“Will there be an inquest?”\\n“There may be. It all depends. If I am able to declare myself absolutely\\nsatisfied that the overdose was taken accidentally, an inquest might be\\ndispensed with.”\\n“And are you absolutely satisfied?” asked my sister shrewdly.\\nI did not answer, but got up from the table.\\nTwo\\nWHO’S WHO IN KING’S ABBOT\\nBefore I proceed further with what I said to Caroline and what Caroline said\\nto me, it might be as well to give some idea of what I should describe as our\\nlocal geography. Our village, King’s Abbot, is, I imagine, very much like\\nany other village. Our big town is Cranchester, nine miles away. We have a\\nlarge railway station, a small post office, and two rival “General Stores.”\\nAble-bodied men are apt to leave the place early in life, but we are rich in\\nunmarried ladies and retired military officers. Our hobbies and recreations\\ncan be summed up in the one word, “gossip.”\\nThere are only two houses of any importance in King’s Abbot. One is\\nKing’s Paddock, left to Mrs. Ferrars by her late husband. The other, Fernly\\nPark, is owned by Roger Ackroyd. Ackroyd has always interested me by\\nbeing a man more impossibly like a country squire than any country squire\\ncould really be. He reminds one of the red-faced sportsmen who always\\nappeared early in the first act of an old-fashioned musical comedy, the\\nsetting being the village green. They usually sang a song about going up to\\nLondon. Nowadays we have revues, and the country squire has died out of\\nmusical fashion.\\nOf course, Ackroyd is not really a country squire. He is an immensely\\nsuccessful manufacturer of (I think) wagon wheels. He is a man of nearly\\nfifty years of age, rubicund of face and genial of manner. He is hand and\\nglove with the vicar, subscribes liberally to parish funds (though rumour has\\nit that he is extremely mean in personal expenditure), encourages cricket\\nmatches, Lads’ Clubs, and Disabled Soldiers’ Institutes. He is, in fact, the\\nlife and soul of our peaceful village of King’s Abbot.\\nNow when Roger Ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one, he fell in love with,\\nand married, a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior. Her name\\nwas Paton, and she was a widow with one child. The history of the marriage\\nwas short and painful. To put it bluntly, Mrs. Ackroyd was a dipsomaniac.\\nShe succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four years after her\\nmarriage.\\nIn the years that followed, Ackroyd showed no disposition to make a\\nsecond matrimonial adventure. His wife’s child by her first marriage was\\nonly seven years old when his mother died. He is now twenty-five. Ackroyd\\nhas always regarded him as his own son, and has brought him up\\naccordingly, but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry and\\ntrouble to his stepfather. Nevertheless we are all very fond of Ralph Paton\\nin King’s Abbot. He is such a good-looking youngster for one thing.\\nAs I said before, we are ready enough to gossip in our village.\\nEverybody noticed from the first that Ackroyd and Mrs. Ferrars got on very\\nwell together. After her husband’s death, the intimacy became more\\nmarked. They were always seen about together, and it was freely\\nconjectured that at the end of her period of mourning, Mrs. Ferrars would\\nbecome Mrs. Roger Ackroyd. It was felt, indeed, that there was a certain\\nfitness in the thing. Roger Ackroyd’s wife had admittedly died of drink.\\nAshley Ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his death. It was\\nonly fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess should make up to\\neach other for all that they had previously endured at the hands of their\\nformer spouses.\\nThe Ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago, but a halo of\\ngossip has surrounded Ackroyd for many years past. All the time that Ralph\\nPaton was growing up to manhood a series of lady housekeepers presided\\nover Ackroyd’s establishment, and each in turn was regarded with lively\\nsuspicion by Caroline and her cronies. It is not too much to say that for at\\nleast fifteen years the whole village has confidently expected Ackroyd to\\nmarry one of his housekeepers. The last of them, a redoubtable lady called\\nMiss Russell, has reigned undisputed for five years, twice as long as any of\\nher predecessors. It is felt that but for the advent of Mrs. Ferrars, Ackroyd\\ncould hardly have escaped. That—and one other factor—the unexpected\\narrival of a widowed sister-in-law with her daughter from Canada. Mrs.\\nCecil Ackroyd, widow of Ackroyd’s ne’er-do-well younger brother, has\\ntaken up her residence at Fernley Park, and has succeeded, according to\\nCaroline, in putting Miss Russell in her proper place.\\nI don’t know exactly what a “proper place” constitutes—it sounds chilly\\nand unpleasant—but I know that Miss Russell goes about with pinched lips,\\nand what I can only describe as an acid smile, and that she professes the\\nutmost sympathy for “poor Mrs. Ackroyd—dependent on the charity of her\\nhusband’s brother. The bread of charity is so bitter, is it not? I should be\\nquite miserable if I did not work for my living.”\\nI don’t know what Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd thought of the Ferrars affair\\nwhen it came on the tapis. It was clearly to her advantage that Ackroyd\\nshould remain unmarried. She was always very charming—not to say\\ngushing—to Mrs. Ferrars when they met. Caroline says that proves less\\nthan nothing.\\nSuch have been our preoccupations in King’s Abbot for the last few\\nyears. We have discussed Ackroyd and his affairs from every standpoint.\\nMrs. Ferrars has fitted into her place in the scheme.\\nNow there has been a rearrangement of the kaleidoscope. From a mild\\ndiscussion of probable wedding presents, we had been jerked into the midst\\nof tragedy.\\nRevolving these and sundry other matters in my mind, I went\\nmechanically on my round. I had no cases of special interest to attend,\\nwhich was, perhaps, as well, for my thoughts returned again and again to\\nthe mystery of Mrs. Ferrars’s death. Had she taken her own life? Surely, if\\nshe had done so, she would have left some word behind to say what she\\ncontemplated doing? Women, in my experience, if they once reach the\\ndetermination to commit suicide, usually wish to reveal the state of mind\\nthat led to the fatal action. They covet the limelight.\\nWhen had I last seen her? Not for over a week. Her manner then had\\nbeen normal enough considering—well—considering everything.\\nThen I suddenly remembered that I had seen her, though not to speak to,\\nonly yesterday. She had been walking with Ralph Paton, and I had been\\nsurprised because I had had no idea that he was likely to be in King’s\\nAbbot. I thought, indeed, that he had quarrelled finally with his stepfather.\\nNothing had been seen of him down here for nearly six months. They had\\nbeen walking along, side by side, their heads close together, and she had\\nbeen talking very earnestly.\\nI think I can safely say that it was at this moment that a foreboding of\\nthe future first swept over me. Nothing tangible as yet—but a vague\\npremonition of the way things were setting. That earnest tête-à-tête between\\nRalph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars the day before struck me disagreeably.\\nI was still thinking of it when I came face to face with Roger Ackroyd.\\n“Sheppard!” he exclaimed. “Just the man I wanted to get hold of. This\\nis a terrible business.”\\n“You’ve heard then?”\\nHe nodded. He had felt the blow keenly, I could see. His big red cheeks\\nseemed to have fallen in, and he looked a positive wreck of his usual jolly,\\nhealthy self.\\n“It’s worse than you know,” he said quietly. “Look here, Sheppard, I’ve\\ngot to talk to you. Can you come back with me now?”\\n“Hardly. I’ve got three patients to see still, and I must be back by twelve\\nto see my surgery patients.”\\n“Then this afternoon—no, better still, dine tonight. At 7:30. Will that\\nsuit you?”\\n“Yes, I can manage that all right. What’s wrong? Is it Ralph?”\\nI hardly knew why I said that—except, perhaps, that it had so often\\nbeen Ralph.\\nAckroyd stared blankly at me as though he hardly understood. I began\\nto realize that there must be something very wrong indeed somewhere. I\\nhad never seen Ackroyd so upset before.\\n“Ralph?” he said vaguely. “Oh! no, it’s not Ralph. Ralph’s in London—\\nDamn! Here’s old Miss Gannett coming. I don’t want to have to talk to her\\nabout this ghastly business. See you tonight, Sheppard. Seven-thirty.”\\nI nodded, and he hurried away, leaving me wondering. Ralph in\\nLondon? But he had certainly been in King’s Abbot the preceding\\nafternoon. He must have gone back to town last night or early this morning,\\nand yet Ackroyd’s manner had conveyed quite a different impression. He\\nhad spoken as though Ralph had not been near the place for months.\\nI had no time to puzzle the matter out further. Miss Gannett was upon\\nme, thirsting for information. Miss Gannett has all the characteristics of my\\nsister Caroline, but she lacks that unerring aim in jumping to conclusions\\nwhich lends a touch of greatness to Caroline’s manoeuvres. Miss Gannett\\nwas breathless and interrogatory.\\nWasn’t it sad about poor dear Mrs. Ferrars? A lot of people were saying\\nshe had been a confirmed drug-taker for years. So wicked the way people\\nwent about saying things. And yet, the worst of it was, there was usually a\\ngrain of truth somewhere in these wild statements. No smoke without fire!\\nThey were saying too that Mr. Ackroyd had found out about it, and had\\nbroken off the engagement—because there was an engagement. She, Miss\\nGannett, had proof positive of that. Of course I must know all about it—\\ndoctors always did—but they never tell?\\nAnd all this with a sharp beady eye on me to see how I reacted to these\\nsuggestions. Fortunately, long association with Caroline has led me to\\npreserve an impassive countenance, and to be ready with small\\nnoncommittal remarks.\\nOn this occasion I congratulated Miss Gannett on not joining in illnatured gossip. Rather a neat counterattack, I thought. It left her in\\ndifficulties, and before she could pull herself together, I had passed on.\\nI went home thoughtful, to find several patients waiting for me in the\\nsurgery.\\nI had dismissed the last of them, as I thought, and was just\\ncontemplating a few minutes in the garden before lunch when I perceived\\none more patient waiting for me. She rose and came towards me as I stood\\nsomewhat surprised.\\nI don’t know why I should have been, except that there is a suggestion\\nof cast iron about Miss Russell, a something that is above the ills of the\\nflesh.\\nAckroyd’s housekeeper is a tall woman, handsome but forbidding in\\nappearance. She has a stern eye, and lips that shut tightly, and I feel that if I\\nwere an under housemaid or a kitchenmaid I should run for my life\\nwhenever I heard her coming.\\n“Good morning, Dr. Sheppard,” said Miss Russell. “I should be much\\nobliged if you would take a look at my knee.”\\nI took a look, but, truth to tell, I was very little wiser when I had done\\nso. Miss Russell’s account of vague pains was so unconvincing that with a\\nwoman of less integrity of character I should have suspected a trumped-up\\ntale. It did cross my mind for one moment that Miss Russell might have\\ndeliberately invented this affection of the knee in order to pump me on the\\nsubject of Mrs. Ferrars’s death, but I soon saw that there, at least, I had\\nmisjudged her. She made a brief reference to the tragedy, nothing more. Yet\\nshe certainly seemed disposed to linger and chat.\\n“Well, thank you very much for this bottle of liniment, doctor,” she said\\nat last. “Not that I believe it will do the least good.”\\nI didn’t think it would either, but I protested in duty bound. After all, it\\ncouldn’t do any harm, and one must stick up for the tools of one’s trade.\\n“I don’t believe in all these drugs,” said Miss Russell, her eyes\\nsweeping over my array of bottles disparagingly. “Drugs do a lot of harm.\\nLook at the cocaine habit.”\\n“Well, as far as that goes—”\\n“It’s very prevalent in high society.”\\nI’m sure Miss Russell knows far more about high society than I do. I\\ndidn’t attempt to argue with her.\\n“Just tell me this, doctor,” said Miss Russell. “Suppose you are really a\\nslave of the drug habit, is there any cure?”\\nOne cannot answer a question like that off-hand. I gave her a short\\nlecture on the subject, and she listened with close attention. I still suspected\\nher of seeking information about Mrs. Ferrars.\\n“Now, Veronal, for instance—” I proceeded.\\nBut, strangely enough, she didn’t seem interested in Veronal. Instead\\nshe changed the subject, and asked me if it was true that there were certain\\npoisons so rare as to baffle detection.\\n“Ah!” I said. “You’ve been reading detective stories.”\\nShe admitted that she had.\\n“The essence of a detective story,” I said, “is to have a rare poison—if\\npossible something from South America, that nobody has ever heard of—\\nsomething that one obscure tribe of savages use to poison their arrows with.\\nDeath is instantaneous, and Western science is powerless to detect it. Is that\\nthe kind of thing you mean?”\\n“Yes. Is there really such a thing?”\\nI shook my head regretfully.\\n“I’m afraid there isn’t. There’s curare, of course.”\\nI told her a good deal about curare, but she seemed to have lost interest\\nonce more. She asked me if I had any in my poison cupboard, and when I\\nreplied in the negative I fancy I fell in her estimation.\\nShe said she must be getting back, and I saw her out at the surgery door\\njust as the luncheon gong went.\\nI should never have suspected Miss Russell of a fondness for detective\\nstories. It pleases me very much to think of her stepping out of the\\nhousekeeper’s room to rebuke a delinquent housemaid, and then returning\\nto a comfortable perusal of The Mystery of the Seventh Death, or something\\nof the kind.\\nThree\\nTHE MAN WHO GREW VEGETABLE MARROWS\\nI told Caroline at lunch that I should be dining at Fernly. She expressed no\\nobjection—on the contrary.\\n“Excellent,” she said. “You’ll hear all about it. By the way, what is the\\ntrouble with Ralph?”\\n“With Ralph?” I said, surprised; “there isn’t any.”\\n“Then why is he staying at the Three Boars instead of at Fernly Park?”\\nI did not for a minute question Caroline’s statement that Ralph Paton\\nwas staying at the local inn. That Caroline said so was enough for me.\\n“Ackroyd told me he was in London,” I said. In the surprise of the\\nmoment I departed from my valuable rule of never parting with\\ninformation.\\n“Oh!” said Caroline. I could see her nose twitching as she worked on\\nthis.\\n“He arrived at the Three Boars yesterday morning,” she said. “And he’s\\nstill there. Last night he was out with a girl.”\\nThat did not surprise me in the least. Ralph, I should say, is out with a\\ngirl most nights of his life. But I did rather wonder that he chose to indulge\\nin the pastime in King’s Abbot instead of in the gay Metropolis.\\n“One of the barmaids?” I asked.\\n“No. That’s just it. He went out to meet her. I don’t know who she is.”\\n(Bitter for Caroline to have to admit such a thing.)\\n“But I can guess,” continued my indefatigable sister.\\nI waited patiently.\\n“His cousin.”\\n“Flora Ackroyd?” I exclaimed in surprise.\\nFlora Ackroyd is, of course, no relation whatever really to Ralph Paton\\nbut Ralph has been looked upon for so long as practically Ackroyd’s own\\nson, that cousinship is taken for granted.\\n“Flora Ackroyd,” said my sister.\\n“But why not go to Fernly if he wanted to see her?”\\n“Secretly engaged,” said Caroline, with immense enjoyment. “Old\\nAckroyd won’t hear of it, and they have to meet this way.”\\nI saw a good many flaws in Caroline’s theory, but I forebore to point\\nthem out to her. An innocent remark about our new neighbour created a\\ndiversion.\\nThe house next door, The Larches, has recently been taken by a\\nstranger. To Caroline’s extreme annoyance, she has not been able to find out\\nanything about him, except that he is a foreigner. The Intelligence Corps\\nhas proved a broken reed. Presumably the man has milk and vegetables and\\njoints of meat and occasional whitings just like everybody else, but none of\\nthe people who make it their business to supply these things seem to have\\nacquired any information. His name, apparently, is Mr. Porrott—a name\\nwhich conveys an odd feeling of unreality. The one thing we do know about\\nhim is that he is interested in the growing of vegetable marrows.\\nBut that is certainly not the sort of information that Caroline is after.\\nShe wants to know where he comes from, what he does, whether he is\\nmarried, what his wife was, or is, like, whether he has children, what his\\nmother’s maiden name was—and so on. Somebody very like Caroline must\\nhave invented the questions on passports, I think.\\n“My dear Caroline,” I said. “There’s no doubt at all about what the\\nman’s profession has been. He’s a retired hairdresser. Look at that\\nmoustache of his.”\\nCaroline dissented. She said that if the man was a hairdresser, he would\\nhave wavy hair—not straight. All hairdressers did.\\nI cited several hairdressers personally known to me who had straight\\nhair, but Caroline refused to be convinced.\\n“I can’t make him out at all,” she said in an aggrieved voice. “I\\nborrowed some garden tools the other day, and he was most polite, but I\\ncouldn’t get anything out of him. I asked him point blank at last whether he\\nwas a Frenchman, and he said he wasn’t—and, somehow, I didn’t like to\\nask him any more.”\\nI began to be more interested in our mysterious neighbour. A man who\\nis capable of shutting up Caroline and sending her, like the Queen of Sheba,\\nempty away, must be something of a personality.\\n“I believe,” said Caroline, “that he’s got one of those new vacuum\\ncleaners—”\\nI saw a meditated loan and the opportunity of further questioning\\ngleaming from her eye. I saw the chance to escape into the garden. I am\\nrather fond of gardening. I was busily exterminating dandelion roots when a\\nshout of warning sounded from close by and a heavy body whizzed by my\\nears and fell at my feet with a repellent squelch. It was a vegetable marrow!\\nI looked up angrily. Over the wall, to my left, there appeared a face. An\\negg-shaped head, partially covered with suspiciously black hair, two\\nimmense moustaches, and a pair of watchful eyes. It was our mysterious\\nneighbour, Mr. Porrott.\\nHe broke at once into fluent apologies.\\n“I demand of you a thousand pardons, monsieur. I am without defence.\\nFor some months now I cultivate the marrows. This morning suddenly I\\nenrage myself with these marrows. I send them to promenade themselves—\\nalas! not only mentally but physically. I seize the biggest. I hurl him over\\nthe wall. Monsieur, I am ashamed. I prostrate myself.”\\nBefore such profuse apologies, my anger was forced to melt. After all,\\nthe wretched vegetable hadn’t hit me. But I sincerely hoped that throwing\\nlarge vegetables over walls was not our new friend’s hobby. Such a habit\\ncould hardly endear him to us as a neighbour.\\nThe strange little man seemed to read my thoughts.\\n“Ah! no,” he exclaimed. “Do not disquiet yourself. It is not with me a\\nhabit. But you can figure to yourself, monsieur, that a man may work\\ntowards a certain object, may labour and toil to attain a certain kind of\\nleisure and occupation, and then find that, after all, he yearns for the old\\nbusy days, and the old occupations that he thought himself so glad to\\nleave?”\\n“Yes,” I said slowly. “I fancy that that is a common enough occurrence.\\nI myself am perhaps an instance. A year ago I came into a legacy—enough\\nto enable me to realize a dream. I have always wanted to travel, to see the\\nworld. Well, that was a year ago, as I said, and—I am still here.”\\nMy little neighbour nodded.\\n“The chains of habit. We work to attain an object, and the object gained,\\nwe find that what we miss is the daily toil. And mark you, monsieur, my\\nwork was interesting work. The most interesting work there is in the\\nworld.”\\n“Yes?” I said encouragingly. For the moment the spirit of Caroline was\\nstrong within me.\\n“The study of human nature, monsieur!”\\n“Just so,” I said kindly.\\nClearly a retired hairdresser. Who knows the secrets of human nature\\nbetter than a hairdresser?\\n“Also, I had a friend—a friend who for many years never left my side.\\nOccasionally of an imbecility to make one afraid, nevertheless he was very\\ndear to me. Figure to yourself that I miss even his stupidity. His naïveté, his\\nhonest outlook, the pleasure of delighting and surprising him by my\\nsuperior gifts—all these I miss more than I can tell you.”\\n“He died?” I asked sympathetically.\\n“Not so. He lives and flourishes—but on the other side of the world. He\\nis now in the Argentine.”\\n“In the Argentine,” I said enviously.\\nI have always wanted to go to South America. I sighed, and then looked\\nup to find Mr. Porrott eyeing me sympathetically. He seemed an\\nunderstanding little man.\\n“Will you go there, yes?” he asked.\\nI shook my head with a sigh.\\n“I could have gone,” I said. “A year ago. But I was foolish—and worse\\nthan foolish—greedy. I risked the substance for the shadow.”\\n“I comprehend,” said Mr. Porrott. “You speculated?”\\nI nodded mournfully, but in spite of myself I felt secretly entertained.\\nThis ridiculous little man was so portentously solemn.\\n“Not the Porcupine Oilfields?” he asked suddenly.\\nI stared.\\n“I thought of them, as a matter of fact, but in the end I plumped for a\\ngold mine in Western Australia.”\\nMy neighbour was regarding me with a strange expression which I\\ncould not fathom.\\n“It is Fate,” he said at last.\\n“What is Fate?” I asked irritably.\\n“That I should live next to a man who seriously considers Porcupine\\nOilfields, and also West Australian Gold Mines. Tell me, have you also a\\npenchant for auburn hair?”\\nI stared at him openmouthed, and he burst out laughing.\\n“No, no, it is not the insanity that I suffer from. Make your mind easy. It\\nwas a foolish question that I put to you there, for, you see, my friend of\\nwhom I spoke was a young man, a man who thought all women good, and\\nmost of them beautiful. But you are a man of middle age, a doctor, a man\\nwho knows the folly and the vanity of most things in this life of ours. Well,\\nwell, we are neighbours. I beg of you to accept and present to your\\nexcellent sister my best marrow.”\\nHe stooped, and with a flourish produced an immense specimen of the\\ntribe, which I duly accepted in the spirit in which it was offered.\\n“Indeed,” said the little man cheerfully, “this has not been a wasted\\nmorning. I have made the acquaintance of a man who in some ways\\nresembles my far-off friend. By the way, I should like to ask you a question.\\nYou doubtless know everyone in this tiny village. Who is the young man\\nwith the very dark hair and eyes, and the handsome face. He walks with his\\nhead flung back, and an easy smile on his lips?”\\nThe description left me in no doubt.\\n“That must be Captain Ralph Paton,” I said slowly.\\n“I have not seen him about here before?”\\n“No, he has not been here for some time. But he is the son—adopted\\nson, rather—of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park.”\\nMy neighbour made a slight gesture of impatience.\\n“Of course, I should have guessed. Mr. Ackroyd spoke of him many\\ntimes.”\\n“You know Mr. Ackroyd?” I said, slightly surprised.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd knew me in London—when I was at work there. I have\\nasked him to say nothing of my profession down here.”\\n“I see,” I said, rather amused by this patent snobbery, as I thought it.\\nBut the little man went on with an almost grandiloquent smirk.\\n“One prefers to remain incognito. I am not anxious for notoriety. I have\\nnot even troubled to correct the local version of my name.”\\n“Indeed,” I said, not knowing quite what to say.\\n“Captain Ralph Paton,” mused Mr. Porrott. “And so he is engaged to\\nMr. Ackroyd’s niece, the charming Miss Flora.”\\n“Who told you so?” I asked, very much surprised.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd. About a week ago. He is very pleased about it—has long\\ndesired that such a thing should come to pass, or so I understood from him.\\nI even believe that he brought some pressure to bear upon the young man.\\nThat is never wise. A young man should marry to please himself—not to\\nplease a stepfather from whom he has expectations.”\\nMy ideas were completely upset. I could not see Ackroyd taking a\\nhairdresser into his confidence, and discussing the marriage of his niece and\\nstepson with him. Ackroyd extends a genial patronage to the lower orders,\\nbut he has a very great sense of his own dignity. I began to think that Porrott\\ncouldn’t be a hairdresser after all.\\nTo hide my confusion, I said the first thing that came into my head.\\n“What made you notice Ralph Paton? His good looks?”\\n“No, not that alone—though he is unusually good-looking for an\\nEnglishman—what your lady novelists would call a Greek God. No, there\\nwas something about that young man that I did not understand.”\\nHe said the last sentence in a musing tone of voice which made an\\nindefinable impression upon me. It was as though he was summing up the\\nboy by the light of some inner knowledge that I did not share. It was that\\nimpression that was left with me, for at that moment my sister’s voice\\ncalled me from the house.\\nI went in. Caroline had her hat on, and had evidently just come in from\\nthe village. She began without preamble.\\n“I met Mr. Ackroyd.”\\n“Yes?” I said.\\n“I stopped him, of course, but he seemed in a great hurry, and anxious\\nto get away.”\\nI have no doubt but that that was the case. He would feel towards\\nCaroline much as he had felt towards Miss Gannett earlier in the day—\\nperhaps more so. Caroline is less easy to shake off.\\n“I asked him at once about Ralph. He was absolutely astonished. Had\\nno idea the boy was down here. He actually said he thought I must have\\nmade a mistake. I! A mistake!”\\n“Ridiculous,” I said. “He ought to have known you better.”\\n“Then he went on to tell me that Ralph and Flora are engaged.”\\n“I knew that, too,” I interrupted, with modest pride.\\n“Who told you?”\\n“Our new neighbour.”\\nCaroline visibly wavered for a second or two, much as if a roulette ball\\nmight coyly hover between two numbers. Then she declined the tempting\\nred herring.\\n“I told Mr. Ackroyd that Ralph was staying at the Three Boars.”\\n“Caroline,” I said, “do you never reflect that you might do a lot of harm\\nwith this habit of yours of repeating everything indiscriminately?”\\n“Nonsense,” said my sister. “People ought to know things. I consider it\\nmy duty to tell them. Mr. Ackroyd was very grateful to me.”\\n“Well,” I said, for there was clearly more to come.\\n“I think he went straight off to the Three Boars, but if so he didn’t find\\nRalph there.”\\n“No?”\\n“No. Because as I was coming back through the wood—”\\n“Coming back through the wood?” I interrupted.\\nCaroline had the grace to blush.\\n“It was such a lovely day,” she exclaimed. “I thought I would make a\\nlittle round. The woods with their autumnal tints are so perfect at this time\\nof year.”\\nCaroline does not care a hang for woods at any time of year. Normally\\nshe regards them as places where you get your feet damp, and where all\\nkinds of unpleasant things may drop on your head. No, it was good sound\\nmongoose instinct which took her to our local wood. It is the only place\\nadjacent to the village of King’s Abbot where you can talk with a young\\nwoman unseen by the whole of the village. It adjoins the Park of Fernly.\\n“Well,” I said, “go on.”\\n“As I say, I was just coming back through the wood when I heard\\nvoices.”\\nCaroline paused.\\n“Yes?”\\n“One was Ralph Paton’s—I knew it at once. The other was a girl’s. Of\\ncourse I didn’t mean to listen—”\\n“Of course not,” I interjected, with patent sarcasm—which was,\\nhowever, wasted on Caroline.\\n“But I simply couldn’t help overhearing. The girl said something—I\\ndidn’t quite catch what it was, and Ralph answered. He sounded very angry.\\n‘My dear girl,’ he said. ‘Don’t you realize that it is quite on the cards the\\nold man will cut me off with a shilling? He’s been pretty fed up with me for\\nthe last few years. A little more would do it. And we need the dibs, my dear.\\nI shall be a very rich man when the old fellow pops off. He’s mean as they\\nmake ’em, but he’s rolling in money really. I don’t want him to go altering\\nhis will. You leave it to me, and don’t worry.’ Those were his exact words. I\\nremember them perfectly. Unfortunately, just then I stepped on a dry twig or\\nsomething, and they lowered their voices and moved away. I couldn’t, of\\ncourse, go rushing after them, so wasn’t able to see who the girl was.”\\n“That must have been most vexing,” I said. “I suppose, though, you\\nhurried on to the Three Boars, felt faint, and went into the bar for a glass of\\nbrandy, and so were able to see if both the barmaids were on duty?”\\n“It wasn’t a barmaid,” said Caroline unhesitatingly. “In fact, I’m almost\\nsure that it was Flora Ackroyd, only—”\\n“Only it doesn’t seem to make sense,” I agreed.\\n“But if it wasn’t Flora, who could it have been?”\\nRapidly my sister ran over a list of maidens living in the\\nneighbourhood, with profuse reasons for and against.\\nWhen she paused for breath, I murmured something about a patient, and\\nslipped out.\\nI proposed to make my way to the Three Boars. It seemed likely that\\nRalph Paton would have returned there by now.\\nI knew Ralph very well—better, perhaps, than anyone else in King’s\\nAbbot, for I had known his mother before him, and therefore I understood\\nmuch in him that puzzled others. He was, to a certain extent, the victim of\\nheredity. He had not inherited his mother’s fatal propensity for drink, but\\nnevertheless he had in him a strain of weakness. As my new friend of this\\nmorning had declared, he was extraordinarily handsome. Just on six feet,\\nperfectly proportioned, with the easy grace of an athlete, he was dark, like\\nhis mother, with a handsome, sunburnt face always ready to break into a\\nsmile. Ralph Paton was of those born to charm easily and without effort. He\\nwas self-indulgent and extravagant, with no veneration for anything on\\nearth, but he was lovable nevertheless, and his friends were all devoted to\\nhim.\\nCould I do anything with the boy? I thought I could.\\nOn inquiry at the Three Boars I found that Captain Paton had just come\\nin. I went up to his room and entered unannounced.\\nFor a moment, remembering what I had heard and seen, I was doubtful\\nof my reception, but I need have had no misgivings.\\n“Why, it’s Sheppard! Glad to see you.”\\nHe came forward to meet me, hand outstretched, a sunny smile lighting\\nup his face.\\n“The one person I am glad to see in this infernal place.”\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n“What’s the place been doing?”\\nHe gave a vexed laugh.\\n“It’s a long story. Things haven’t been going well with me, doctor. But\\nhave a drink, won’t you?”\\n“Thanks,” I said, “I will.”\\nHe pressed the bell, then coming back threw himself into a chair.\\n“Not to mince matters,” he said gloomily, “I’m in the devil of a mess. In\\nfact, I haven’t the least idea what to do next.”\\n“What’s the matter?” I asked sympathetically.\\n“It’s my confounded stepfather.”\\n“What has he done?”\\n“It isn’t what he’s done yet, but what he’s likely to do.”\\nThe bell was answered, and Ralph ordered the drinks. When the man\\nhad gone again, he sat hunched in the armchair, frowning to himself.\\n“Is it really—serious?” I asked.\\nHe nodded.\\n“I’m fairly up against it this time,” he said soberly.\\nThe unusual ring of gravity in his voice told me that he spoke the truth.\\nIt took a good deal to make Ralph grave.\\n“In fact,” he continued, “I can’t see my way ahead…I’m damned if I\\ncan.”\\n“If I could help—” I suggested diffidently.\\nBut he shook his head very decidedly.\\n“Good of you, doctor. But I can’t let you in on this. I’ve got to play a\\nlone hand.”\\nHe was silent a minute and then repeated in a slightly different tone of\\nvoice:\\n“Yes—I’ve got to play a lone hand….”\\nFour\\nDINNER AT FERNLY\\nI\\nIt was just a few minutes before half past seven when I rang the frontdoor\\nbell of Fernly Park. The door was opened with admirable promptitude by\\nParker, the butler.\\nThe night was such a fine one that I had preferred to come on foot. I\\nstepped into the big square hall and Parker relieved me of my overcoat. Just\\nthen Ackroyd’s secretary, a pleasant young fellow by the name of\\nRaymond, passed through the hall on his way to Ackroyd’s study, his hands\\nfull of papers.\\n“Good evening, doctor. Coming to dine? Or is this a professional call?”\\nThe last was in allusion to my black bag which I had laid down on the\\noak chest.\\nI explained that I expected a summons to a confinement case at any\\nmoment, and so had come out prepared for an emergency call. Raymond\\nnodded, and went on his way, calling over his shoulder:\\n“Go into the drawing room. You know the way. ladies will be down in a\\nminute. I must just take these papers to Mr. Ackroyd, and I’ll tell him\\nyou’re here.”\\nOn Raymond’s appearance Parker had withdrawn, so I was alone in the\\nhall. I settled my tie, glanced in a large mirror which hung there, and\\ncrossed to the door directly facing me, which was, as I knew, the door of the\\ndrawing room.\\nI noticed, just as I was turning the handle, a sound from within—the\\nshutting down of a window, I took it to be. I noticed it, I may say, quite\\nmechanically, without attaching any importance to it at the time.\\nI opened the door and walked in. As I did so I almost collided with Miss\\nRussell who was just coming out. We both apologized.\\nFor the first time I found myself appraising the housekeeper and\\nthinking what a handsome woman she must once have been—indeed, as far\\nas that goes, still was. Her dark hair was unstreaked with grey, and when\\nshe had a colour, as she had at this minute, the stern quality of her looks\\nwas not so apparent.\\nQuite subconsciously I wondered whether she had been out, for she was\\nbreathing hard, as though she had been running.\\n“I’m afraid I’m a few minutes early,” I said.\\n“Oh! I don’t think so. It’s gone half past seven, Dr. Sheppard.” She\\npaused a minute before saying, “I—didn’t know you were expected to\\ndinner tonight. Mr. Ackroyd didn’t mention it.”\\nI received a vague impression that my dining there displeased her in\\nsome way, but I couldn’t imagine why.\\n“How’s the knee?” I inquired.\\n“Much the same, thank you, doctor. I must be going now. Mrs. Ackroyd\\nwill be down in a moment. I—I only came in here to see if the flowers were\\nall right.”\\nShe passed quickly out of the room. I strolled to the window, wondering\\nat her evident desire to justify her presence in the room. As I did so, I saw\\nwhat, of course, I might have known all the time had I troubled to give my\\nmind to it, namely, that the windows were long french ones opening on the\\nterrace. The sound I had heard, therefore, could not have been that of a\\nwindow being shut down.\\nQuite idly, and more to distract my mind from painful thoughts than for\\nany other reason, I amused myself by trying to guess what could have\\ncaused the sound in question.\\nCoals on the fire? No, that was not the kind of noise at all. A drawer of\\na bureau pushed in? No, not that.\\nThen my eye was caught by what, I believe, is called a silver table, the\\nlid of which lifts, and through the glass of which you can see the contents. I\\ncrossed over to it, studying the contents. There were one or two pieces of\\nold silver, a baby shoe belonging to King Charles the First, some Chinese\\njade figures, and quite a number of African implements and curios. Wanting\\nto examine one of the jade figures more closely, I lifted the lid. It slipped\\nthrough my fingers and fell.\\nAt once I recognized the sound I had heard. It was this same table lid\\nbeing shut down gently and carefully. I repeated the action once or twice for\\nmy own satisfaction. Then I lifted the lid to scrutinize the contents more\\nclosely.\\nI was still bending over the open silver table when Flora Ackroyd came\\ninto the room.\\nQuite a lot of people do not like Flora Ackroyd, but nobody can help\\nadmiring her. And to her friends she can be very charming. The first thing\\nthat strikes you about her is her extraordinary fairness. She has the real\\nScandinavian pale gold hair. Her eyes are blue—blue as the waters of a\\nNorwegian fiord, and her skin is cream and roses. She has square, boyish\\nshoulders and slight hips. And to a jaded medical man it is very refreshing\\nto come across such perfect health.\\nA simple straightforward English girl—I may be old-fashioned, but I\\nthink the genuine article takes a lot of beating.\\nFlora joined me by the silver table, and expressed heretical doubts as to\\nKing Charles I ever having worn the baby shoe.\\n“And anyway,” continued Miss Flora, “all this making a fuss about\\nthings because someone wore or used them seems to me all nonsense.\\nThey’re not wearing or using them now. That pen that George Eliot wrote\\nThe Mill on the Floss with—that sort of thing—well, it’s only just a pen\\nafter all. If you’re really keen on George Eliot, why not get The Mill on the\\nFloss in a cheap edition and read it.”\\n“I suppose you never read such old out-of-date stuff, Miss Flora?”\\n“You’re wrong, Dr. Sheppard. I love The Mill on the Floss.”\\nI was rather pleased to hear it. The things young women read nowadays\\nand profess to enjoy positively frighten me.\\n“You haven’t congratulated me yet, Dr. Sheppard,” said Flora. “Haven’t\\nyou heard?”\\nShe held out her left hand. On the third finger of it was an exquisitely\\nset single pearl.\\n“I’m going to marry Ralph, you know,” she went on. “Uncle is very\\npleased. It keeps me in the family, you see.”\\nI took both her hands in mine.\\nMy dear,” I said, “I hope you’ll be very happy.”\\n“We’ve been engaged for about a month,” continued Flora in her cool\\nvoice, “but it was only announced yesterday. Uncle is going to do up Crossstones, and give it to us to live in, and we’re going to pretend to farm.\\nReally, we shall hunt all the winter, town for the season, and then go\\nyachting. I love the sea. And, of course, I shall take a great interest in the\\nparish affairs, and attend all the Mothers’ Meetings.”\\nJust then Mrs. Ackroyd rustled in, full of apologies for being late.\\nI am sorry to say I detest Mrs. Ackroyd. She is all chains and teeth and\\nbones. A most unpleasant woman. She has small pale flinty blue eyes, and\\nhow ever gushing her words may be, those eyes of hers always remain\\ncoldly speculative.\\nI went across to her, leaving Flora by the window. She gave me a\\nhandful of assorted knuckles and rings to squeeze, and began talking\\nvolubly.\\nHad I heard about Flora’s engagement? So suitable in every way. The\\ndear young things had fallen in love at first sight. Such a perfect pair, he so\\ndark and she so fair.\\n“I can’t tell you, my dear Dr. Sheppard, the relief to a mother’s heart.”\\nMrs. Ackroyd sighed—a tribute to her mother’s heart, whilst her eyes\\nremained shrewdly observant of me.\\n“I was wondering. You are such an old friend of dear Roger’s. We know\\nhow much he trusts to your judgment. So difficult for me—in my position\\nas poor Cecil’s widow. But there are so many tiresome things—settlements,\\nyou know—all that. I fully believe that Roger intends to make settlements\\nupon dear Flora, but, as you know, he is just a leetle peculiar about money.\\nVery usual, I’ve heard, amongst men who are captains of industry. I\\nwondered, you know, if you could just sound him on the subject? Flora is so\\nfond of you. We feel you are quite an old friend, although we have only\\nreally known you just over two years.”\\nMrs. Ackroyd’s eloquence was cut short as the drawing room door\\nopened once more. I was pleased at the interruption. I hate interfering in\\nother people’s affairs, and I had not the least intention of tackling Ackroyd\\non the subject of Flora’s settlements. In another moment I should have been\\nforced to tell Mrs. Ackroyd as much.\\n“You know Major Blunt, don’t you, doctor?”\\n“Yes, indeed,” I said.\\nA lot of people know Hector Blunt—at least by repute. He has shot\\nmore wild animals in unlikely places than any man living, I suppose. When\\nyou mention him, people say: “Blunt—you don’t mean the big game man,\\ndo you?”\\nHis friendship with Ackroyd has always puzzled me a little. The two\\nmen are so totally dissimilar. Hector Blunt is perhaps five years Ackroyd’s\\njunior. They made friends early in life, and though their ways have\\ndiverged, the friendship still holds. About once in two years Blunt spends a\\nfortnight at Fernly, and an immense animal’s head, with an amazing number\\nof horns which fixes you with a glazed stare as soon as you come inside the\\nfront door, is a permanent reminder of the friendship.\\nBlunt had entered the room now with his own peculiar, deliberate, yet\\nsoft-footed tread. He is a man of medium height, sturdily and rather stockily\\nbuilt. His face is almost mahogany coloured, and is peculiarly\\nexpressionless. He has grey eyes that give the impression of always\\nwatching something that is happening very far away. He talks little, and\\nwhat he does say is said jerkily, as though the words were forced out of him\\nunwillingly.\\nHe said now: “How are you, Sheppard?” in his usual abrupt fashion,\\nand then stood squarely in front of the fireplace looking over our heads as\\nthough he saw something very interesting happening in Timbuctoo.\\n“Major Blunt,” said Flora, “I wish you’d tell me about these African\\nthings. I’m sure you know what they all are.”\\nI have heard Hector Blunt described as a woman hater, but I noticed that\\nhe joined Flora at the silver table with what might be described as alacrity.\\nThey bent over it together.\\nI was afraid Mrs. Ackroyd would begin talking about settlements again,\\nso I made a few hurried remarks about the new sweet pea. I knew there was\\na newsweet pea because the Daily Mail had told me so that morning. Mrs.\\nAckroyd knows nothing about horticulture, but she is the kind of woman\\nwho likes to appear well-informed about the topics of the day, and she, too,\\nreads the Daily Mail. We were able to converse quite intelligently until\\nAckroyd and his secretary joined us, and immediately afterwards Parker\\nannounced dinner.\\nMy place at table was between Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora. Blunt was on\\nMrs. Ackroyd’s other side, and Geoffrey Raymond next to him.\\nDinner was not a cheerful affair. Ackroyd was visibly preoccupied. He\\nlooked wretched, and ate next to nothing. Mrs. Ackroyd, Raymond, and I\\nkept the conversation going. Flora seemed affected by her uncle’s\\ndepression, and Blunt relapsed into his usual taciturnity.\\nII\\nImmediately after dinner Ackroyd slipped his arm through mine and led me\\noff to his study.\\n“Once we’ve had coffee, we shan’t be disturbed again,” he explained. “I\\ntold Raymond to see to it that we shouldn’t be interrupted.”\\nI studied him quietly without appearing to do so. He was clearly under\\nthe influence of some strong excitement. For a minute or two he paced up\\nand down the room, then, as Parker entered with the coffee tray, he sank\\ninto an armchair in front of the fire.\\nThe study was a comfortable apartment. Bookshelves lined one wall of\\nit. The chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather. A large desk stood\\nby the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and filed. On a\\nround table were various magazines and sporting papers.\\n“I’ve had a return of that pain after food lately,” remarked Ackroyd\\ncalmly, as he helped himself to coffee. “You must give me some more of\\nthose tablets of yours.”\\nIt struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our\\nconference was a medical one. I played up accordingly.\\n“I thought as much. I brought some up with me.”\\n“Good man. Hand them over now.”\\n“They’re in my bag in the hall. I’ll get them.”\\nAckroyd arrested me.\\n“Don’t you trouble. Parker will get them. Bring in the doctor’s bag, will\\nyou, Parker?”\\n“Very good, sir.”\\nParker withdrew. As I was about to speak, Ackroyd threw up his hand.\\n“Not yet. Wait. Don’t you see I’m in such a state of nerves that I can\\nhardly contain myself?”\\nI saw that plainly enough. And I was very uneasy. All sorts of\\nforebodings assailed me.\\nAckroyd spoke again almost immediately.\\n“Make certain that window’s closed, will you,” he asked.\\nSomewhat surprised, I got up and went to it. It was not a french\\nwindow, but one of the ordinary sash type. The heavy blue velvet curtains\\nwere drawn in front of it, but the window itself was open at the top.\\nParker reentered the room with my bag while I was still at the window.\\n“That’s all right,” I said, emerging again into the room.\\n“You’ve put the latch across?”\\n“Yes, yes. What’s the matter with you, Ackroyd?”\\nThe door had just closed behind Parker, or I would not have put the\\nquestion.\\nAckroyd waited just a minute before replying.\\n“I’m in hell,” he said slowly, after a minute. “No, don’t bother with\\nthose damn tablets. I only said that for Parker. Servants are so curious.\\nCome here and sit down. The door’s closed too, isn’t it?”\\n“Yes. Nobody can overhear; don’t be uneasy.”\\n“Sheppard, nobody knows what I’ve gone through in the last twentyfour hours. If a man’s house ever fell in ruin about him, mine has about me.\\nThis business of Ralph’s is the last straw. But we won’t talk about that now.\\nIt’s the other—the other—! I don’t know what to do about it. And I’ve got\\nto make up my mind soon.”\\n“What’s the trouble?”\\nAckroyd remained silent for a minute or two. He seemed curiously\\naverse to begin. When he did speak, the question he asked came as a\\ncomplete surprise. It was the last thing I expected.\\n“Sheppard, you attended Ashley Ferrars in his last illness, didn’t you?”\\n“Yes, I did.”\\nHe seemed to find even greater difficulty in framing his next question.\\n“Did you ever suspect—did it ever enter your head—that—well, that he\\nmight have been poisoned?”\\nI was silent for a minute or two. Then I made up my mind what to say.\\nRoger Ackroyd was not Caroline.\\n“I’ll tell you the truth,” I said. “At the time I had no suspicion whatever,\\nbut since—well, it was mere idle talk on my sister’s part that first put the\\nidea into my head. Since then I haven’t been able to get it out again. But,\\nmind you, I’ve no foundation whatever for that suspicion.”\\n“He was poisoned,” said Ackroyd.\\nHe spoke in a dull heavy voice.\\n“Who by?” I asked sharply.\\n“His wife.”\\n“How do you know that?”\\n“She told me so herself.”\\n“When?”\\n“Yesterday! My God! yesterday! It seems ten years ago.”\\nI waited a minute, then he went on.\\n“You understand, Sheppard, I’m telling you this in confidence. It’s to go\\nno further. I want your advice—I can’t carry the whole weight by myself.\\nAs I said just now, I don’t know what to do.”\\n“Can you tell me the whole story?” I said. “I’m still in the dark. How\\ndid Mrs. Ferrars come to make this confession to you?”\\n“It’s like this. Three months ago I asked Mrs. Ferrars to marry me. She\\nrefused. I asked her again and she consented, but she refused to allow me to\\nmake the engagement public until her year of mourning was up. Yesterday I\\ncalled upon her, pointed out that a year and three weeks had now elapsed\\nsince her husband’s death, and that there could be no further objection to\\nmaking the engagement public property. I had noticed that she had been\\nvery strange in her manner for some days. Now, suddenly, without the least\\nwarning, she broke down completely. She—she told me everything. Her\\nhatred of her brute of a husband, her growing love for me, and the—the\\ndreadful means she had taken. Poison! My God! It was murder in cold\\nblood.”\\nI saw the repulsion, the horror, in Ackroyd’s face. So Mrs. Ferrars must\\nhave seen it. Ackroyd’s is not the type of the great lover who can forgive all\\nfor love’s sake. He is fundamentally a good citizen. All that was sound and\\nwholesome and law-abiding in him must have turned from her utterly in\\nthat moment of revelation.\\n“Yes,” he went on, in a low, monotonous voice, “she confessed\\neverything. It seems that there is one person who has known all along—\\nwho has been blackmailing her for huge sums. It was the strain of that that\\ndrove her nearly mad.”\\n“Who was the man?”\\nSuddenly before my eyes there arose the picture of Ralph Paton and\\nMrs. Ferrars side by side. Their heads so close together. I felt a momentary\\nthrob of anxiety. Supposing—oh! but surely that was impossible. I\\nremembered the frankness of Ralph’s greeting that very afternoon. Absurd!\\n“She wouldn’t tell me his name,” said Ackroyd slowly. “As a matter of\\nfact, she didn’t actually say that it was a man. But of course—”\\n“Of course,” I agreed. “It must have been a man. And you’ve no\\nsuspicion at all?”\\nFor answer Ackroyd groaned and dropped his head into his hands.\\n“It can’t be,” he said. “I’m mad even to think of such a thing. No, I\\nwon’t even admit to you the wild suspicion that crossed my mind. I’ll tell\\nyou this much, though. Something she said made me think that the person\\nin question might be actually among my household—but that can’t be so. I\\nmust have misunderstood her.”\\n“What did you say to her?” I asked.\\n“What could I say? She saw, of course, the awful shock it had been to\\nme. And then there was the question, what was my duty in the matter? She\\nhad made me, you see, an accessory after the fact. She saw all that, I think,\\nquicker than I did. I was stunned, you know. She asked me for twenty-four\\nhours—made me promise to do nothing till the end of that time. And she\\nsteadfastly refused to give me the name of the scoundrel who had been\\nblackmailing her. I suppose she was afraid that I might go straight off and\\nhammer him, and then the fat would have been in the fire as far as she was\\nconcerned. She told me that I should hear from her before twenty-four\\nhours had passed. My God! I swear to you, Sheppard, that it never entered\\nmy head what she meant to do. Suicide! And I drove her to it.”\\n“No, no,” I said. “Don’t take an exaggerated view of things. The\\nresponsibility for her death doesn’t lie at your door.”\\n“The question is, what am I to do now? The poor lady is dead. Why\\nrake up past trouble?”\\n“I rather agree with you,” I said.\\n“But there’s another point. How am I to get hold of that scoundrel who\\ndrove her to death as surely as if he’d killed her? He knew of the first crime,\\nand he fastened on to it like some obscene vulture. She’s paid the penalty. Is\\nhe to go scot free?”\\n“I see,” I said slowly. “You want to hunt him down? It will mean a lot of\\npublicity, you know.”\\n“Yes, I’ve thought of that. I’ve zigzagged to and fro in my mind.”\\n“I agree with you that the villain ought to be punished, but the cost has\\ngot to be reckoned.”\\nAckroyd rose and walked up and down. Presently he sank into the chair\\nagain.\\n“Look here, Sheppard, suppose we leave it like this. If no word comes\\nfrom her, we’ll let the dead things lie.”\\n“What do you mean by word coming from her?” I asked curiously.\\n“I have the strongest impression that somewhere or somehow she must\\nhave left a message for me—before she went. I can’t argue about it, but\\nthere it is.”\\nI shook my head.\\n“She left no letter or word of any kind?” I asked.\\n“Sheppard, I’m convinced that she did. And more, I’ve a feeling that by\\ndeliberately choosing death, she wanted the whole thing to come out, if\\nonly to be revenged on the man who drove her to desperation. I believe that\\nif I could have seen her then, she would have told me his name and bid me\\ngo for him for all I was worth.”\\nHe looked at me.\\n“You don’t believe in impressions?”\\n“Oh, yes, I do, in a sense. If, as you put it, word should come from her\\n—”\\nI broke off. The door opened noiselessly and Parker entered with a\\nsalver on which were some letters.\\n“The evening post, sir,” he said, handing the salver to Ackroyd.\\nThen he collected the coffee cups and withdrew.\\nMy attention, diverted for a moment, came back to Ackroyd. He was\\nstaring like a man turned to stone at a long blue envelope. The other letters\\nhe had let drop to the ground.\\n“Her writing,” he said in a whisper. “She must have gone out and\\nposted it last night, just before—before—”\\nHe ripped open the envelope and drew out a thick enclosure. Then he\\nlooked up sharply.\\n“You’re sure you shut the window?” he said.\\n“Quite sure,” I said, surprised. “Why?”\\n“All this evening I’ve had a queer feeling of being watched, spied upon.\\nWhat’s that—”\\nHe turned sharply. So did I. We both had the impression of hearing the\\nlatch of the door give ever so slightly. I went across to it and opened it.\\nThere was no one there.\\n“Nerves,” murmured Ackroyd to himself.\\nHe unfolded the thick sheets of paper, and read aloud in a low voice.\\n“My dear, my very dear Roger,—A life calls for a life. I see that\\n—I saw it in your face this afternoon. So I am taking the only road\\nopen to me. I leave to you the punishment of the person who has\\nmade my life a hell upon earth for the last year. I would not tell you\\nthe name, this afternoon, but I propose to write it to you now. I have\\nno children or near relations to be spared, so do not fear publicity. If\\nyou can, Roger, my very dear Roger, forgive me the wrong I meant to\\ndo you, since when the time came, I could not do it after all….”\\nAckroyd, his finger on the sheet to turn it over, paused.\\n“Sheppard, forgive me, but I must read this alone,” he said unsteadily.\\n“It was meant for my eyes, and my eyes only.”\\nHe put the letter in the envelope and laid it on the table.\\n“Later, when I am alone.”\\n“No,” I cried impulsively, “read it now.”\\nAckroyd stared at me in some surprise.\\n“I beg your pardon,” I said, reddening. “I do not mean read it aloud to\\nme. But read it through whilst I am still here.”\\nAckroyd shook his head.\\n“No, I’d rather wait.”\\nBut for some reason, obscure to myself, I continued to urge him.\\n“At least, read the name of the man,” I said.\\nNow Ackroyd is essentially pigheaded. The more you urge him to do a\\nthing, the more determined he is not to do it. All my arguments were in\\nvain.\\nThe letter had been brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was just on\\nten minutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I hesitated with\\nmy hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering if there was\\nanything I had left undone. I could think of nothing. With a shake of the\\nhead I passed out and closed the door behind me.\\nI was startled by seeing the figure of Parker close at hand. He looked\\nembarrassed, and it occurred to me that he might have been listening at the\\ndoor.\\nWhat a fat, smug, oily face the man had, and surely there was\\nsomething decidedly shifty in his eye.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd particularly does not want to be disturbed,” I said coldly.\\n“He told me to tell you so.”\\n“Quite so, sir. I—I fancied I heard the bell ring.”\\nThis was such a palpable untruth that I did not trouble to reply.\\nPreceding me to the hall, Parker helped me on with my overcoat, and I\\nstepped out into the night. The moon was overcast, and every thing seemed\\nvery dark and still.\\nThe village church clock chimed nine o’clock as I passed through the\\nlodge gates. I turned to the left towards the village, and almost cannoned\\ninto a man coming in the opposite direction.\\n“This the way to Fernly Park, mister?” asked the stranger in a hoarse\\nvoice.\\nI looked at him. He was wearing a hat pulled down over his eyes, and\\nhis coat collar turned up. I could see little or nothing of his face, but he\\nseemed a young fellow. The voice was rough and uneducated.\\n“These are the lodge gates here,” I said.\\n“Thank you, mister.” He paused, and then added, quite unnecessarily,\\n“I’m a stranger in these parts, you see.”\\nHe went on, passing through the gates as I turned to look after him.\\nThe odd thing was that his voice reminded me of someone’s voice that I\\nknew, but whose it was I could not think.\\nTen minutes later I was at home once more. Caroline was full of\\ncuriosity to know why I had returned so early. I had to make up a slightly\\nfictitious account of the evening in order to satisfy her, and I had an uneasy\\nfeeling that she saw through the transparent device.\\nAt ten o’clock I rose, yawned, and suggested bed. Caroline acquiesced.\\nIt was Friday night, and on Friday night I wind the clocks. I did it as\\nusual, whilst Caroline satisfied herself that the servants had locked up the\\nkitchen properly.\\nIt was a quarter past ten as we went up the stairs. I had just reached the\\ntop when the telephone rang in the hall below.\\n“Mrs. Bates,” said Caroline immediately.\\n“I’m afraid so,” I said ruefully.\\nI ran down the stairs and took up the receiver.\\n“What?” I said. “What? Certainly, I’ll come at once.”\\nI ran upstairs, caught up my bag, and stuffed a few extra dressings into\\nit.\\n“Parker telephoning,” I shouted to Caroline, “from Fernly. They’ve just\\nfound Roger Ackroyd murdered.”\\nFive\\nMURDER\\nI got out the car in next to no time, and drove rapidly to Fernly. Jumping\\nout, I pulled the bell impatiently. There was some delay in answering, and I\\nrang again.\\nThen I heard the rattle of the chain and Parker, his impassivity of\\ncountenance quite unmoved, stood in the open doorway.\\nI pushed past him into the hall.\\n“Where is he?” I demanded sharply.\\n“I beg your pardon, sir?”\\n“Your master. Mr. Ackroyd. Don’t stand there staring at me, man. Have\\nyou notified the police?”\\n“The police, sir? Did you say the police?” Parker stared at me as though\\nI were a ghost.\\n“What’s the matter with you, Parker? If, as you say, your master has\\nbeen murdered—”\\nA gasp broke from Parker.\\n“The master? Murdered? Impossible, sir!”\\nIt was my turn to stare.\\n“Didn’t you telephone to me, not five minutes ago, and tell me that Mr.\\nAckroyd had been found murdered?”\\n“Me, sir? Oh! no indeed, sir. I wouldn’t dream of doing such a thing.”\\n“Do you mean to say it’s all a hoax? That there’s nothing the matter\\nwith Mr. Ackroyd?”\\n“Excuse me, sir, did the person telephoning use my name?”\\n“I’ll give you the exact words I heard. ‘Is that Dr. Sheppard? Parker,\\nthe butler at Fernly, speaking. Will you please come at once, sir. Mr.\\nAckroyd has been murdered.’”\\nParker and I stared at each other blankly.\\n“A very wicked joke to play, sir,” he said at last, in a shocked tone.\\n“Fancy saying a thing like that.”\\n“Where is Mr. Ackroyd?” I asked suddenly.\\n“Still in the study, I fancy, sir. The ladies have gone to bed, and Major\\nBlunt and Mr. Raymond are in the billiard room.”\\n“I think I’ll just look in and see him for a minute,” I said. “I know he\\ndidn’t want to be disturbed again, but this odd practical joke has made me\\nuneasy. I’d just like to satisfy myself that he’s all right.”\\n“Quite so, sir. It makes me feel quite uneasy myself. If you don’t object\\nto my accompanying you as far as the door, sir—?”\\n“Not at all,” I said. “Come along.”\\nI passed through the door on the right, Parker on my heels, traversed the\\nlittle lobby where a small flight of stairs led upstairs to Ackroyd’s bedroom,\\nand tapped on the study door.\\nThere was no answer. I turned the handle, but the door was locked.\\n“Allow me, sir,” said Parker.\\nVery nimbly, for a man of his build, he dropped on one knee and applied\\nhis eye to the keyhole.\\n“Key is in the lock all right, sir,” he said, rising. “On the inside. Mr.\\nAckroyd must have locked himself in and possibly just dropped off to\\nsleep.”\\nI bent down and verified Parker’s statement.\\n“It seems all right,” I said, “but, all the same, Parker, I’m going to wake\\nyour master up. I shouldn’t be satisfied to go home without hearing from his\\nown lips that he’s quite all right.”\\nSo saying, I rattled the handle and called out, “Ackroyd, Ackroyd, just a\\nminute.”\\nBut still there was no answer. I glanced over my shoulder.\\n“I don’t want to alarm the household,” I said hesitatingly.\\nParker went across and shut the door from the big hall through which\\nwe had come.\\n“I think that will be all right now, sir. The billiard room is at the other\\nside of the house, and so are the kitchen quarters and the ladies’ bedrooms.”\\nI nodded comprehendingly. Then I banged once more frantically on the\\ndoor, and stooping down, fairly bawled through the keyhole:\\n“Ackroyd, Ackroyd! It’s Sheppard. Let me in.”\\nAnd still—silence. Not a sign of life from within the locked room.\\nParker and I glanced at each other.\\n“Look here, Parker,” I said, “I’m going to break this door in—or rather,\\nwe are. I’ll take the responsibility.”\\n“If you say so, sir,” said Parker, rather doubtfully.\\n“I do say so. I’m seriously alarmed about Mr. Ackroyd.”\\nI looked round the small lobby and picked up a heavy oak chair. Parker\\nand I held it between us and advanced to the assault. Once, twice, and three\\ntimes we hurled it against the lock. At the third blow it gave, and we\\nstaggered into the room.\\nAckroyd was sitting as I had left him in the armchair before the fire. His\\nhead had fallen sideways, and clearly visible, just below the collar of his\\ncoat, was a shining piece of twisted metalwork.\\nParker and I advanced till we stood over the recumbent figure. I heard\\nthe butler draw in his breath with a sharp hiss.\\n“Stabbed from be’ind,” he murmured. “‘Orrible!”\\nHe wiped his moist brow with his handkerchief, then stretched out a\\ngingerly hand towards the hilt of the dagger.\\n“You mustn’t touch that,” I said sharply. “Go at once to the telephone\\nand ring up the police station. Inform them of what has happened. Then tell\\nMr. Raymond and Major Blunt.”\\n“Very good, sir.”\\nParker hurried away, still wiping his perspiring brow.\\nI did what little had to be done. I was careful not to disturb the position\\nof the body, and not to handle the dagger at all. No object was to be attained\\nby moving it. Ackroyd had clearly been dead some little time.\\nThen I heard young Raymond’s voice, horror-stricken and incredulous,\\noutside.\\n“What do you say? Oh! impossible! Where’s the doctor?”\\nHe appeared impetuously in the doorway, then stopped dead, his face\\nvery white. A hand put him aside, and Hector Blunt came past him into the\\nroom.\\n“My God!” said Raymond from behind him; “it’s true, then.”\\nBlunt came straight on till he reached the chair. He bent over the body,\\nand I thought that, like Parker, he was going to lay hold of the dagger hilt. I\\ndrew him back with one hand.\\n“Nothing must be moved,” I explained. “The police must see him\\nexactly as he is now.”\\nBlunt nodded in instant comprehension. His face was expressionless as\\never, but I thought I detected signs of emotion beneath the stolid mask.\\nGeoffrey Raymond had joined us now, and stood peering over Blunt’s\\nshoulder at the body.\\n“This is terrible,” he said in a low voice.\\nHe had regained his composure, but as he took off the pince-nez he\\nhabitually wore and polished them I observed that his hand was shaking.\\n“Robbery, I suppose,” he said. “How did the fellow get in? Through the\\nwindow? Has anything been taken?”\\nHe went towards the desk.\\n“You think it’s burglary?” I said slowly.\\n“What else could it be? There’s no question of suicide, I suppose?”\\n“No man could stab himself in such a way,” I said confidently. “It’s\\nmurder right enough. But with what motive?”\\n“Roger hadn’t an enemy in the world,” said Blunt quietly. “Must have\\nbeen burglars. But what was the thief after? Nothing seems to be\\ndisarranged?”\\nHe looked round the room. Raymond was still sorting the papers on the\\ndesk.\\n“There seems nothing missing, and none of the drawers show signs of\\nhaving been tampered with,” the secretary observed at last. “It’s very\\nmysterious.”\\nBlunt made a slight motion with his head.\\n“There are some letters on the floor here,” he said.\\nI looked down. Three or four letters still lay where Ackroyd had\\ndropped them earlier in the evening.\\nBut the blue envelope containing Mrs. Ferrar’s letter had disappeared. I\\nhalf opened my mouth to speak, but at that moment the sound of a bell\\npealed through the house. There was a confused murmur of voices in the\\nhall, and then Parker appeared with our local inspector and a police\\nconstable.\\n“Good evening, gentlemen,” said the inspector. “I’m terribly sorry for\\nthis! A good kind gentleman like Mr. Ackroyd. The butler says it’s murder.\\nNo possibility of accident or suicide, doctor?”\\n“None whatever,” I said.\\n“Ah! A bad business.”\\nHe came and stood over the body.\\n“Been moved at all?” he asked sharply.\\n“Beyond making certain that life was extinct—an easy matter—I have\\nnot disturbed the body in any way.”\\n“Ah! And everything points to the murderer having got clear away—for\\nthe moment, that is. Now then, let me hear all about it. Who found the\\nbody?”\\nI explained the circumstances carefully.\\n“A telephone message, you say? From the butler?”\\n“A message that I never sent,” declared Parker earnestly. “I’ve not been\\nnear the telephone the whole evening. The others can bear me out that I\\nhaven’t.”\\n“Very odd, that. Did it sound like Parker’s voice, doctor?”\\n“Well—I can’t say I noticed. I took it for granted, you see.”\\n“Naturally. Well, you got up here, broke in the door, and found poor Mr.\\nAckroyd like this. How long should you say he had been dead, doctor?”\\n“Half an hour at least—perhaps longer,” I said.\\n“The door was locked on the inside, you say? What about the window?”\\n“I myself closed and bolted it earlier in the evening at Mr. Ackroyd’s\\nrequest.”\\nThe inspector strode across to it and threw back the curtains.\\n“Well, it’s open now, anyway,” he remarked.\\nTrue enough, the window was open, the lower sash being raised to its\\nfullest extent.\\nThe inspector produced a pocket torch and flashed it along the sill\\noutside.\\n“This is the way he went all right,” he remarked, “and got in. See here.”\\nIn the light of the powerful torch, several clearly defined footmarks\\ncould be seen. They seemed to be those of shoes with rubber studs in the\\nsoles. One particularly clear one pointed inwards, another, slightly\\noverlapping it, pointed outwards.\\n“Plain as a pikestaff,” said the inspector. “Any valuables missing?”\\nGeoffrey Raymond shook his head.\\n“Not so far that we can discover. Mr. Ackroyd never kept anything of\\nparticular value in this room.”\\n“H’m,” said the inspector. “Man found an open window. Climbed in,\\nsaw Mr. Ackroyd sitting there—maybe he’d fallen asleep. Man stabbed him\\nfrom behind, then lost his nerve and made off. But he’s left his tracks pretty\\nclearly. We ought to get hold of him without much difficulty. No suspicious\\nstrangers been hanging about anywhere?”\\n“Oh!” I said suddenly.\\n“What is it, doctor?”\\n“I met a man this evening—just as I was turning out of the gate. He\\nasked me the way to Fernly Park.”\\n“What time would that be?”\\n“Just nine o’clock. I heard it chime the hour as I was turning out of the\\ngate.”\\n“Can you describe him?”\\nI did so to the best of my ability.\\nThe inspector turned to the butler.\\n“Anyone answering that description come to the front door?”\\n“No, sir. No one has been to the house at all this evening.”\\n“What about the back?”\\n“I don’t think so, sir, but I’ll make inquiries.”\\nHe moved towards the door, but the inspector held up a large hand.\\n“No, thanks. I’ll do my own inquiring. But first of all I want to fix the\\ntimes a little more clearly. When was Mr. Ackroyd last seen alive?”\\n“Probably by me,” I said, “when I left at—let me see—about ten\\nminutes to nine. He told me that he didn’t wish to be disturbed, and I\\nrepeated the order to Parker.”\\n“Just so, sir,” said Parker respectfully.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd was certainly alive at half past nine,” put in Raymond,\\n“for I heard his voice in here talking.”\\n“Who was he talking to?”\\n“That I don’t know. Of course, at the time I took it for granted that it\\nwas Dr. Sheppard who was with him. I wanted to ask him a question about\\nsome papers I was engaged upon, but when I heard the voices I\\nremembered that he had said he wanted to talk to Dr. Sheppard without\\nbeing disturbed, and I went away again. But now it seems that the doctor\\nhad already left?”\\nI nodded.\\n“I was at home by a quarter past nine,” I said. “I didn’t go out again\\nuntil I received the telephone call.”\\n“Who could have been with him at half past nine?” queried the\\ninspector. “It wasn’t you, Mr—er—”\\n“Major Blunt,” I said.\\n“Major Hector Blunt?” asked the inspector, a respectful tone creeping\\ninto his voice.\\nBlunt merely jerked his head affirmatively.\\n“I think we’ve seen you down here before, sir,” said the inspector. “I\\ndidn’t recognize you for the moment, but you were staying with Mr.\\nAckroyd a year ago last May.”\\n“June,” corrected Blunt.\\n“Just so, June it was. Now, as I was saying, it wasn’t you with Mr.\\nAckroyd at nine-thirty this evening?”\\nBlunt shook his head.\\n“Never saw him after dinner,” he volunteered.\\nThe inspector turned once more to Raymond.\\n“You didn’t overhear any of the conversation going on, did you, sir?”\\n“I did catch just a fragment of it,” said the secretary, “and, supposing as\\nI did that it was Dr. Sheppard who was with Mr. Ackroyd, that fragment\\nstruck me as distinctly odd. As far as I can remember, the exact words were\\nthese. Mr. Ackroyd was speaking. ‘The calls on my purse have been so\\nfrequent of late’—that is what he was saying—‘of late, that I fear it is\\nimpossible for me to accede to your request…’ I went away again at once,\\nof course, so I did not hear any more. But I rather wondered because Dr.\\nSheppard—”\\n“—Does not ask for loans for himself or subscriptions for others,” I\\nfinished.\\n“A demand for money,” said the inspector musingly. “It may be that\\nhere we have a very important clue.” He turned to the butler. “You say,\\nParker, that nobody was admitted by the front door this evening?”\\n“That’s what I say, sir.”\\n“Then it seems almost certain that Mr. Ackroyd himself must have\\nadmitted this stranger. But I don’t quite see—”\\nThe inspector went into a kind of daydream for some minutes.\\n“One thing’s clear,” he said at length, rousing himself from his\\nabsorption. “Mr. Ackroyd was alive and well at nine-thirty. That is the last\\nmoment at which he is known to have been alive.”\\nParker gave vent to an apologetic cough which brought the inspector’s\\neyes on him at once.\\n“Well?” he said sharply.\\n“If you’ll excuse me, sir, Miss Flora saw him after that.”\\n“Miss Flora?”\\n“Yes, sir. About a quarter to ten that would be. It was after that that she\\ntold me Mr. Ackroyd wasn’t to be disturbed again tonight.”\\n“Did he send her to you with that message?”\\n“Not exactly, sir. I was bringing a tray with soda and whisky when Miss\\nFlora, who was just coming out of this room, stopped me and said her uncle\\ndidn’t want to be disturbed.”\\nThe inspector looked at the butler with rather closer attention than he\\nhad bestowed on him up to now.\\n“You’d already been told that Mr. Ackroyd didn’t want to be disturbed,\\nhadn’t you?”\\nParker began to stammer. His hands shook.\\n“Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Quite so, sir.”\\n“And yet you were proposing to do so?”\\n“I’d forgotten, sir. At least I mean, I always bring the whisky and soda\\nabout that time, sir, and ask if there’s anything more, and I thought—well, I\\nwas doing as usual without thinking.”\\nIt was at this moment that it began to dawn upon me that Parker was\\nmost suspiciously flustered. The man was shaking and twitching all over.\\n“H’m,” said the inspector. “I must see Miss Ackroyd at once. For the\\nmoment we’ll leave this room exactly as it is. I can return here after I’ve\\nheard what Miss Ackroyd has to tell me. I shall just take the precaution of\\nshutting and bolting the window.”\\nThis precaution accomplished, he led the way into the hall and we\\nfollowed him. He paused a moment, as he glanced up at the little staircase,\\nthen spoke over his shoulder to the constable.\\n“Jones, you’d better stay here. Don’t let anyone go into that room.”\\nParker interposed deferentially.\\n“If you’ll excuse me, sir. If you were to lock the door into the main hall,\\nnobody could gain access to this part. That staircase leads only to Mr.\\nAckroyd’s bedroom and bathroom. There is no communication with the\\nother part of the house. There once was a door through, but Mr. Ackroyd\\nhad it blocked up. He liked to feel that his suite was entirely private.”\\nTo make things clear and explain the position, I have appended a rough\\nsketch of the right-hand wing of the house. The small staircase leads, as\\nParker explained, to a big bedroom made by two being knocked into one,\\nand an adjoining bathroom and lavatory.\\nThe inspector took in the position at a glance. We went through into the\\nlarge hall and he locked the door behind him, slipping the key into his\\npocket. Then he gave the constable some low-voiced instructions, and the\\nlatter prepared to depart.\\n“We must get busy on those shoe tracks,” explained the inspector. “But\\nfirst of all, I must have a word with Miss Ackroyd. She was the last person\\nto see her uncle alive. Does she know yet?”\\nRaymond shook his head.\\n“Well, no need to tell her for another five minutes. She can answer my\\nquestions better without being upset by knowing the truth about her uncle.\\nTell her there’s been a burglary, and ask her if she would mind dressing and\\ncoming down to answer a few questions.”\\nIt was Raymond who went upstairs on this errand.\\n“Miss Ackroyd will be down in a minute,” he said, when he returned. “I\\ntold her just what you suggested.”\\nIn less than five minutes Flora descended the staircase. She was\\nwrapped in a pale pink silk kimono. She looked anxious and excited.\\nThe inspector stepped forward.\\n“Good evening, Miss Ackroyd,” he said civilly. “We’re afraid there’s\\nbeen an attempt at robbery, and we want you to help us. What’s this room—\\nthe billiard room? Come in here and sit down.”\\nFlora sat down composedly on the wide divan which ran the length of\\nthe wall, and looked up at the inspector.\\n“I don’t quite understand. What has been stolen? What do you want me\\nto tell you?”\\n“It’s just this, Miss Ackroyd. Parker here says you came out of your\\nuncle’s study at about a quarter to ten. Is that right?”\\n“Quite right. I had been to say goodnight to him.”\\n“And the time is correct?”\\n“Well, it must have been about then. I can’t say exactly. It might have\\nbeen later.”\\n“Was your uncle alone, or was there anyone with him?”\\n“He was alone. Dr. Sheppard had gone.”\\n“Did you happen to notice whether the window was open or shut?”\\nFlora shook her head.\\n“I can’t say. The curtains were drawn.”\\n“Exactly. And your uncle seemed quite as usual?”\\n“I think so.”\\n“Do you mind telling us exactly what passed between you?”\\nFlora paused a minute, as though to collect her recollections.\\n“I went in and said, ‘Goodnight, Uncle, I’m going to bed now. I’m tired\\ntonight.’ He gave a sort of grunt, and—I went over and kissed him, and he\\nsaid something about my looking nice in the frock I had on, and then he\\ntold me to run away as he was busy. So I went.”\\n“Did he ask specially not to be disturbed?”\\n“Oh! yes, I forgot. He said: ‘Tell Parker I don’t want anything more\\ntonight, and that he’s not to disturb me.’ I met Parker just outside the door\\nand gave him Uncle’s message.”\\n“Just so,” said the inspector.\\n“Won’t you tell me what it is that has been stolen?”\\n“We’re not quite—certain,” said the inspector hesitatingly.\\nA wide look of alarm came into the girl’s eyes. She started up.\\n“What is it? You’re hiding something from me?”\\nMoving in his usual unobtrusive manner, Hector Blunt came between\\nher and the inspector. She half stretched out her hand, and he took it in both\\nof his, patting it as though she were a very small child, and she turned to\\nhim as though something in his stolid, rocklike demeanour promised\\ncomfort and safety.\\n“It’s bad news, Flora,” he said quietly. “Bad news for all of us. Your\\nUncle Roger—”\\n“Yes?”\\n“It will be a shock to you. Bound to be. Poor Roger’s dead.”\\nFlora drew away from him, her eyes dilating with horror.\\n“When?” she whispered. “When?”\\n“Very soon after you left him, I’m afraid,” said Blunt gravely.\\nFlora raised her hand to her throat, gave a little cry, and I hurried to\\ncatch her as she fell. She had fainted, and Blunt and I carried her upstairs\\nand laid her on her bed. Then I got him to wake Mrs. Ackroyd and tell her\\nthe news. Flora soon revived, and I brought her mother to her, telling her\\nwhat to do for the girl. Then I hurried downstairs again.\\nSix\\nTHE TUNISIAN DAGGER\\nI met the inspector just coming from the door which led into the kitchen\\nquarters.\\n“How’s the young lady, doctor?”\\n“Coming round nicely. Her mother’s with her.”\\n“That’s good. I’ve been questioning the servants. They all declare that\\nno one has been to the back door tonight. Your description of that stranger\\nwas rather vague. Can’t you give us something more definite to go upon?”\\n“I’m afraid not,” I said regretfully. “It was a dark night, you see, and the\\nfellow had his coat collar well pulled up and his hat squashed down over his\\neyes.”\\n“H’m,” said the inspector. “Looked as though he wanted to conceal his\\nface. Sure it was no one you know?”\\nI replied in the negative, but not as decidedly as I might have done. I\\nremembered my impression that the stranger’s voice was not unfamiliar to\\nme. I explained this rather haltingly to the inspector.\\n“It was a rough, uneducated voice, you say?”\\nI agreed, but it occurred to me that the roughness had been of an almost\\nexaggerated quality. If, as the inspector thought, the man had wished to hide\\nhis face, he might equally well have tried to disguise his voice.\\n“Do you mind coming into the study with me again, doctor? There are\\none or two things I want to ask you.”\\nI acquiesced. Inspector Davis unlocked the door of the lobby, we passed\\nthrough, and he locked the door again behind him.\\n“We don’t want to be disturbed,” he said grimly. “And we don’t want\\nany eavesdropping either. What’s all this about blackmail?”\\n“Blackmail!” I exclaimed, very much startled.\\n“Is it an effort of Parker’s imagination? Or is there something in it?”\\n“If Parker heard anything about blackmail,” I said slowly, “he must\\nhave been listening outside this door with his ear glued against the\\nkeyhole.”\\nDavis nodded.\\n“Nothing more likely. You see, I’ve been instituting a few inquiries as to\\nwhat Parker has been doing with himself this evening. To tell the truth, I\\ndidn’t like his manner. The man knows something. When I began to\\nquestion him, he got the wind up, and plumped out some garbled story of\\nblackmail.”\\nI took an instant decision.\\n“I’m rather glad you’ve brought the matter up,” I said. “I’ve been trying\\nto decide whether to make a clean breast of things or not. I’d already\\npractically decided to tell you everything, but I was going to wait for a\\nfavourable opportunity. You might as well have it now.”\\nAnd then and there I narrated the whole events of the evening as I have\\nset them down here. The inspector listened keenly, occasionally interjecting\\na question.\\n“Most extraordinary story I ever heard,” he said, when I had finished.\\n“And you say that letter has completely disappeared? It looks bad—it looks\\nvery bad indeed. It gives us what we’ve been looking for—a motive for the\\nmurder.”\\nI nodded.\\n“I realize that.”\\n“You say that Mr. Ackroyd hinted at a suspicion he had that some\\nmember of his household was involved? Household’s rather an elastic\\nterm.”\\n“You don’t think that Parker himself might be the man we’re after?” I\\nsuggested.\\n“It looks very like it. He was obviously listening at the door when you\\ncame out. Then Miss Ackroyd came across him later bent on entering the\\nstudy. Say he tried again when she was safely out of the way. He stabbed\\nAckroyd, locked the door on the inside, opened the window, and got out\\nthat way, and went round to a side door which he had previously left open.\\nHow’s that?”\\n“There’s only one thing against it,” I said slowly. “If Ackroyd went on\\nreading that letter as soon as I left, as he intended to do, I don’t see him\\ncontinuing to sit on here and turn things over in his mind for another hour.\\nHe’d have had Parker in at once, accused him then and there, and there\\nwould have been a fine old uproar. Remember, Ackroyd was a man of\\ncholeric temper.”\\n“Mightn’t have had time to go on with the letter just then,” suggested\\nthe inspector. “We know someone was with him at half past nine. If that\\nvisitor turned up as soon as you left, and after he went, Miss Ackroyd came\\nin to say goodnight—well, he wouldn’t be able to go on with the letter until\\nclose upon ten o’clock.”\\n“And the telephone call?”\\n“Parker sent that all right—perhaps before he thought of the locked\\ndoor and open window. Then he changed his mind—or got in a panic—and\\ndecided to deny all knowledge of it. That was it, depend upon it.”\\n“Ye—es,” I said rather doubtfully.\\n“Anyway, we can find out the truth about the telephone call from the\\nexchange. If it was put through from here, I don’t see how anyone else but\\nParker could have sent it. Depend upon it, he’s our man. But keep it dark—\\nwe don’t want to alarm him just yet, till we’ve got all the evidence. I’ll see\\nto it he doesn’t give us the slip. To all appearances we’ll be concentrating\\non your mysterious stranger.”\\nHe rose from where he had been sitting astride the chair belonging to\\nthe desk, and crossed over to the still form in the armchair.\\n“The weapon ought to give us a clue,” he remarked, looking up. “It’s\\nsomething quite unique—a curio, I should think, by the look of it.”\\nHe bent down, surveying the handle attentively, and I heard him give a\\ngrunt of satisfaction. Then, very gingerly, he pressed his hands down below\\nthe hilt and drew the blade out from the wound. Still carrying it so as not to\\ntouch the handle, he placed it in a wide china mug which adorned the\\nmantelpiece.\\n“Yes,” he said, nodding at it. “Quite a work of art. There can’t be many\\nof them about.”\\nIt was indeed a beautiful object. A narrow, tapering blade, and a hilt of\\nelaborately intertwined metals of curious and careful workmanship. He\\ntouched the blade gingerly with his finger, testing its sharpness, and made\\nan appreciative grimace.\\n“Lord, what an edge,” he exclaimed. “A child could drive that into a\\nman—as easy as cutting butter. A dangerous sort of toy to have about.”\\n“May I examine the body properly now?” I asked.\\nHe nodded.\\n“Go ahead.”\\nI made a thorough examination.\\n“Well?” said the inspector, when I had finished.\\n“I’ll spare you the technical language,” I said. “We’ll keep that for the\\ninquest. The blow was delivered by a right-handed man standing behind\\nhim, and death must have been instantaneous. By the expression on the\\ndead man’s face, I should say that the blow was quite unexpected. He may\\nhave died without knowing who his assailant was.”\\n“Butlers can creep about as soft-footed as cats,” said Inspector Davis.\\n“There’s not going to be much mystery about this crime. Take a look at the\\nhilt of that dagger.”\\nI took the look.\\n“I dare say they’re not apparent to you, but I can see them clearly\\nenough.” He lowered his voice. “Fingerprints!”\\nHe stood off a few steps to judge of his effect.\\n“Yes,” I said mildly. “I guessed that.”\\nI do not see why I should be supposed to be totally devoid of\\nintelligence. After all, I read detective stories, and the newspapers, and am a\\nman of quite average ability. If there had been toe marks on the dagger\\nhandle, now, that would have been quite a different thing. I would then have\\nregistered any amount of surprise and awe.\\nI think the inspector was annoyed with me for declining to get thrilled.\\nHe picked up the china mug and invited me to accompany him to the\\nbilliard room.\\n“I want to see if Mr. Raymond can tell us anything about this dagger,”\\nhe explained.\\nLocking the outer door behind us again, we made our way to the billiard\\nroom, where we found Geoffrey Raymond. The inspector held up his\\nexhibit.\\n“Ever seen this before, Mr. Raymond?”\\n“Why—I believe—I’m almost sure that is a curio given to Mr. Ackroyd\\nby Major Blunt. It comes from Morocco—no, Tunis. So the crime was\\ncommitted with that? What an extraordinary thing. It seems almost\\nimpossible, and yet there could hardly be two daggers the same. May I fetch\\nMajor Blunt?”\\nWithout waiting for an answer, he hurried off.\\n“Nice young fellow that,” said the inspector. “Something honest and\\ningenuous about him.”\\nI agreed. In the two years that Geoffrey Raymond has been secretary to\\nAckroyd, I have never seen him ruffled or out of temper. And he has been, I\\nknow, a most efficient secretary.\\nIn a minute or two Raymond returned, accompanied by Blunt.\\n“I was right,” said Raymond excitedly. “It is the Tunisian dagger.”\\n“Major Blunt hasn’t looked at it yet,” objected the inspector.\\n“Saw it the moment I came into the study,” said the quiet man.\\n“You recognized it, then?”\\nBlunt nodded.\\n“You said nothing about it,” said the inspector suspiciously.\\n“Wrong moment,” said Blunt. “Lot of harm done by blurting out things\\nat the wrong time.”\\nHe returned the inspector’s stare placidly enough.\\nThe latter grunted at last and turned away. He brought the dagger over\\nto Blunt.\\n“You’re quite sure about it, sir. You identify it positively?”\\n“Absolutely. No doubt whatever.”\\n“Where was this—er—curio usually kept? Can you tell me that, sir?”\\nIt was the secretary who answered.\\n“In the silver table in the drawing room.”\\n“What?” I exclaimed.\\nThe others looked at me.\\n“Yes, doctor?” said the inspector encouragingly.\\n“It’s nothing,” said the inspector again, still encouragingly.\\n“It’s so trivial,” I explained apologetically. “Only that when I arrived\\nlast night for dinner I heard the lid of the silver table being shut down in the\\ndrawing room.”\\nI saw profound scepticism and a trace of suspicion on the inspector’s\\ncountenance.\\n“How did you know it was the silver table lid?”\\nI was forced to explain in detail—a long, tedious explanation which I\\nwould infinitely rather not have had to make.\\nThe inspector heard me to the end.\\n“Was the dagger in its place when you were looking over the contents?”\\nhe asked.\\n“I don’t know,” I said. “I can’t say I remember noticing it—but, of\\ncourse, it may have been there all the time.”\\n“We’d better get hold of the housekeeper,” remarked the inspector, and\\npulled the bell.\\nA few minutes later Miss Russell, summoned by Parker, entered the\\nroom.\\n“I don’t think I went near the silver table,” she said, when the inspector\\nhad posed his question. “I was looking to see that all the flowers were fresh.\\nOh! yes, I remember now. The silver table was open—which it had no\\nbusiness to be, and I shut the lid down as I passed.”\\nShe looked at him aggressively.\\n“I see,” said the inspector. “Can you tell me if this dagger was in its\\nplace then?”\\nMiss Russell looked at the weapon composedly.\\n“I can’t say I’m sure,” she replied. “I didn’t stop to look. I knew the\\nfamily would be down any minute, and I wanted to get away.”\\n“Thank you,” said the inspector.\\nThere was just a trace of hesitation in his manner, as though he would\\nhave liked to question her further, but Miss Russell clearly accepted the\\nwords as a dismissal, and glided from the room.\\n“Rather a Tartar, I should fancy, eh?” said the inspector, looking after\\nher. “Let me see. This silver table is in front of one of the windows, I think\\nyou said, doctor?”\\nRaymond answered for me.\\n“Yes, the left-hand window.”\\n“And the window was open?”\\n“They were both ajar.”\\n“Well, I don’t think we need go into the question much further.\\nSomebody—I’ll just say somebody—could get that dagger any time he\\nliked, and exactly when he got it doesn’t matter in the least. I’ll be coming\\nup in the morning with the chief constable, Mr. Raymond. Until then, I’ll\\nkeep the key of that door. I want Colonel Melrose to see everything exactly\\nas it is. I happen to know that he’s dining out the other side of the county,\\nand, I believe, staying the night….”\\nWe watched the inspector take up the jar.\\n“I shall have to pack this carefully,” he observed. “It’s going to be an\\nimportant piece of evidence in more ways than one.”\\nA few minutes later as I came out of the billiard room with Raymond,\\nthe latter gave a low chuckle of amusement.\\nI felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and followed the direction of\\nhis eyes. Inspector Davis seemed to be inviting Parker’s opinion of a small\\npocket diary.\\n“A little obvious,” murmured my companion. “So Parker is the suspect,\\nis he? Shall we oblige Inspector Davis with a set of our fingerprints also?”\\nHe took two cards from the card tray, wiped them with his silk\\nhandkerchief, then handed one to me and took the other himself. Then, with\\na grin, he handed them to the police inspector.\\n“Souvenirs,” he said. “No. 1. Dr. Sheppard; No. 2, my humble self. One\\nfrom Major Blunt will be forthcoming in the morning.”\\nYouth is very buoyant. Even the brutal murder of his friend and\\nemployer could not dim Geoffrey Raymond’s spirits for long. Perhaps that\\nis as it should be. I do not know. I have lost the quality of resilience long\\nsince myself.\\nIt was very late when I got back, and I hoped that Caroline would have\\ngone to bed. I might have known better.\\nShe had hot cocoa waiting for me, and whilst I drank it, she extracted\\nthe whole history of the evening from me. I said nothing of the\\nblackmailing business, but contented myself with giving her the facts of the\\nmurder.\\n“The police suspect Parker,” I said, as I rose to my feet and prepared to\\nascend to bed. “There seems a fairly clear case against him.”\\n“Parker!” said my sister. “Fiddlesticks! That inspector must be a perfect\\nfool. Parker indeed! Don’t tell me.” With which obscure pronouncement we\\nwent up to bed.\\nSeven\\nI LEARN MY NEIGHBOUR’S PROFESSION\\nOn the following morning I hurried unforgivably over my round. My\\nexcuse can be that I had no very serious cases to attend. On my return\\nCaroline came into the hall to greet me.\\n“Flora Ackroyd is here,” she announced in an excited whisper.\\n“What?”\\nI concealed my surprise as best as I could.\\n“She’s very anxious to see you. She’s been here half an hour.”\\nCaroline led the way into our small sitting room, and I followed.\\nFlora was sitting on the sofa by the window. She was in black and she\\nsat nervously twisting her hands together. I was shocked by the sight of her\\nface. All the colour had faded away from it. But when she spoke her\\nmanner was as composed and resolute as possible.\\n“Dr. Sheppard, I have come to ask you to help me?”\\n“Of course he’ll help you, my dear,” said Caroline.\\nI don’t think Flora really wished Caroline to be present at the interview.\\nShe would, I am sure, have infinitely preferred to speak to me privately. But\\nshe also wanted to waste no time, so she made the best of it.\\n“I want you to come to The Larches with me.”\\n“The Larches?” I queried, surprised.\\n“To see that funny little man?” exclaimed Caroline.\\n“Yes. You know who he is, don’t you?”\\n“We fancied,” I said, “that he might be a retired hairdresser.”\\nFlora’s blue eyes opened very wide.\\n“Why, he’s Hercule Poirot! You know who I mean—the private\\ndetective. They say he’s done the most wonderful things—just like\\ndetectives do in books. A year ago he retired and came to live down here.\\nUncle knew who he was, but he promised not to tell anyone, because M.\\nPoirot wanted to live quietly without being bothered by people.”\\n“So that’s who he is,” I said slowly.\\n“You’ve heard of him, of course?”\\n“I’m rather an old fogey, as Caroline tells me,” I said, “but I have just\\nheard of him.”\\n“Extraordinary!” commented Caroline.\\nI don’t know what she was referring to—possibly her own failure to\\ndiscover the truth.\\n“You want to go and see him?” I asked slowly. “Now why?”\\n“To get him to investigate this murder, of course,” said Caroline sharply.\\n“Don’t be so stupid, James.”\\nI was not really being stupid. Caroline does not always understand what\\nI am driving at.\\n“You haven’t got confidence in Inspector Davis?” I went on.\\n“Of course she hasn’t,” said Caroline. “I haven’t either.”\\nAnyone would have thought it was Caroline’s uncle who had been\\nmurdered.\\n“And how do you know he would take up the case?” I asked.\\n“Remember he has retired from active work.”\\n“That’s just it,” said Flora simply. “I’ve got to persuade him.”\\n“You are sure you are doing wisely?” I asked gravely.\\n“Of course she is,” said Caroline. “I’ll go with her myself if she likes.”\\n“I’d rather the doctor came with me, if you don’t mind, Miss Sheppard,”\\nsaid Flora.\\nShe knows the value of being direct on certain occasions. Any hints\\nwould certainly have been wasted on Caroline.\\n“You see,” she explained, following directness with tact, “Dr. Sheppard\\nbeing the doctor, and having found the body, he would be able to give all\\nthe details to M. Poirot.”\\n“Yes,” said Caroline grudgingly, “I see that.”\\nI took a turn or two up and down the room.\\n“Flora,” I said gravely, “be guided by me. I advise you not to drag this\\ndetective into the case.”\\nFlora sprang to her feet. The colour rushed into her cheeks.\\n“I know why you say that,” she cried. “But it’s exactly for that reason\\nI’m so anxious to go. You’re afraid! But I’m not. I know Ralph better than\\nyou do.”\\n“Ralph!” said Caroline. “What has Ralph got to do with it?”\\nNeither of us heeded her.\\n“Ralph may be weak,” continued Flora. “He may have done foolish\\nthings in the past—wicked things even—but he wouldn’t murder anyone.”\\n“No, no,” I exclaimed. “I never thought it of him.”\\n“Then why did you go to the Three Boars last night?” demanded Flora.\\n“On your way home—after Uncle’s body was found?”\\nI was momentarily silenced. I had hoped that that visit of mine would\\nremain unnoticed.\\n“How did you know about that?” I countered.\\n“I went there this morning,” said Flora. “I heard from the servants that\\nRalph was staying there—”\\nI interrupted her.\\n“You had no idea that he was in King’s Abbot?”\\n“No. I was astounded. I couldn’t understand it. I went there and asked\\nfor him. They told me, what I suppose they told you last night, that he went\\nout at about nine o’clock yesterday evening—and—and never came back.”\\nHer eyes met mine defiantly, and as though answering something in my\\nlook, she burst out:\\n“Well, why shouldn’t he? He might have gone—anywhere. He may\\neven have gone back to London.”\\n“Leaving his luggage behind?” I asked gently.\\nFlora stamped her foot.\\n“I don’t care. There must be a simple explanation.”\\n“And that’s why you want to go to Hercule Poirot? Isn’t it better to\\nleave things as they are? The police don’t suspect Ralph in the least,\\nremember. They’re working on quite another tack.”\\n“But that’s just it,” cried the girl. “They do suspect him. A man from\\nCranchester turned up this morning—Inspector Raglan, a horrid, weaselly\\nlittle man. I found he had been to the Three Boars this morning before me.\\nThey told me all about his having been there, and the questions he had\\nasked. He must think Ralph did it.”\\n“That’s a change of mind from last night, if so,” I said slowly. “He\\ndoesn’t believe in Davis’s theory that it was Parker then?”\\n“Parker indeed,” said my sister, and snorted.\\nFlora came forward and laid her hand on my arm.\\n“Oh! Dr. Sheppard, let us go at once to this M. Poirot. He will find out\\nthe truth.”\\n“My dear Flora,” I said gently, laying my hand on hers. “Are you quite\\nsure it is the truth we want?”\\nShe looked at me, nodding her head gravely.\\n“You’re not sure,” she said. “I am. I know Ralph better than you do.”\\n“Of course he didn’t do it,” said Caroline, who had been keeping silent\\nwith great difficulty. “Ralph may be extravagant, but he’s a dear boy, and\\nhas the nicest manners.”\\nI wanted to tell Caroline that large numbers of murderers have had nice\\nmanners, but the presence of Flora restrained me. Since the girl was\\ndetermined, I was forced to give in to her and we started at once, getting\\naway before my sister was able to fire off any more pronouncements\\nbeginning with her favourite words, “Of course.”\\nAn old woman with an immense Breton cap opened the door of The\\nLarches to us. M. Poirot was at home, it seemed.\\nWe were ushered into a little sitting room arranged with formal\\nprecision, and there, after a lapse of a minute or so, my friend of yesterday\\ncame to us.\\n“Monsieur le docteur,” he said, smiling. “Mademoiselle.”\\nHe bowed to Flora.\\n“Perhaps,” I began, “you have heard of the tragedy which occurred last\\nnight.”\\nHis face grew grave.\\n“But certainly I have heard. It is horrible. I offer mademoiselle all my\\nsympathy. In what way can I serve you?”\\n“Miss Ackroyd,” I said, “wants you to—to—”\\n“To find the murderer,” said Flora in a clear voice.\\n“I see,” said the little man. “But the police will do that, will they not?”\\n“They might make a mistake,” said Flora. “They are on their way to\\nmake a mistake now, I think. Please, M. Poirot, won’t you help us? If—if it\\nis a question of money—”\\nPoirot held up his hand.\\n“Not that, I beg of you, mademoiselle. Not that I do not care for\\nmoney.” His eyes showed a momentary twinkle. “Money, it means much to\\nme and always has done. No, if I go into this, you must understand one\\nthing clearly. I shall go through with it to the end. The good dog, he does\\nnot leave the scent, remember! You may wish that, after all, you had left it\\nto the local police.”\\n“I want the truth,” said Flora, looking him straight in the eyes.\\n“All the truth?”\\n“All the truth.”\\n“Then I accept,” said the little man quietly. “And I hope you will not\\nregret those words. Now, tell me all the circumstances.”\\n“Dr. Sheppard had better tell you,” said Flora. “He knows more than I\\ndo.”\\nThus enjoined, I plunged into a careful narrative, embodying all the\\nfacts I have previously set down. Poirot listened carefully, inserting a\\nquestion here and there, but for the most part sitting in silence, his eyes on\\nthe ceiling.\\nI brought my story to a close with the departure of the inspector and\\nmyself from Fernly Park the previous night.\\n“And now,” said Flora, as I finished, “tell him all about Ralph.”\\nI hesitated, but her imperious glance drove me on.\\n“You went to this inn—this Three Boars—last night on your way\\nhome?” asked Poirot, as I brought my tale to a close. “Now exactly why\\nwas that?”\\nI paused a moment to choose my words carefully.\\n“I thought someone ought to inform the young man of his uncle’s death.\\nIt occurred to me after I had left Fernly that possibly no one but myself and\\nMr. Ackroyd were aware that he was staying in the village.”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“Quite so. That was your only motive in going there, eh?”\\n“That was my only motive,” I said stiffly.\\n“It was not to—shall we say—reassure yourself about ce jeune\\nhomme?”\\n“Reassure myself?”\\n“I think, M. le docteur, that you know very well what I mean, though\\nyou pretend not to do so. I suggest that it would have been a relief to you if\\nyou had found that Captain Paton had been at home all the evening.”\\n“Not at all,” I said sharply.\\nThe little detective shook his head at me gravely.\\n“You have not the trust in me of Miss Flora,” he said. “But no matter.\\nWhat we have to look at is this—Captain Paton is missing, under\\ncircumstances which call for an explanation. I will not hide from you that\\nthe matter looks grave. Still, it may admit of a perfectly simple\\nexplanation.”\\n“That’s just what I keep saying,” cried Flora eagerly.\\nPoirot touched no more upon that theme. Instead he suggested an\\nimmediate visit to the local police. He thought it better for Flora to return\\nhome, and for me to be the one to accompany him there and introduce him\\nto the officer in charge of the case.\\nWe carried out this plan forthwith. We found Inspector Davis outside\\nthe police station looking very glum indeed. With him was Colonel\\nMelrose, the Chief Constable, and another man whom, from Flora’s\\ndescription of “weaselly,” I had no difficulty in recognizing as Inspector\\nRaglan from Cranchester.\\nI know Melrose fairly well, and I introduced Poirot to him and\\nexplained the situation. The chief constable was clearly vexed, and\\nInspector Raglan looked as black as thunder. Davis, however, seemed\\nslightly exhilarated by the sight of his superior officer’s annoyance.\\n“The case is going to be plain as a pikestaff,” said Raglan. “Not the\\nleast need for amateurs to come butting in. You’d think any fool would have\\nseen the way things were last night, and then we shouldn’t have lost twelve\\nhours.”\\nHe directed a vengeful glance at poor Davis, who received it with\\nperfect stolidity.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd’s family must, of course, do what they see fit,” said\\nColonel Melrose. “But we cannot have the official investigation hampered\\nin any way. I know M. Poirot’s great reputation, of course,” he added\\ncourteously.\\n“The police can’t advertise themselves, worse luck,” said Raglan.\\nIt was Poirot who saved the situation.\\n“It is true that I have retired from the world,” he said. “I never intended\\nto take up a case again. Above all things, I have a horror of publicity. I must\\nbeg, that in the case of my being able to contribute something to the\\nsolution of the mystery, my name may not be mentioned.”\\nInspector Raglan’s face lightened a little.\\n“I’ve heard of some very remarkable successes of yours,” observed the\\ncolonel, thawing.\\n“I have had much experience,” said Poirot quietly. “But most of my\\nsuccesses have been obtained by the aid of the police. I admire enormously\\nyour English police. If Inspector Raglan permits me to assist him, I shall be\\nboth honoured and flattered.”\\nThe inspector’s countenance became still more gracious.\\nColonel Melrose drew me aside.\\n“From all I hear, this little fellow’s done some really remarkable\\nthings,” he murmured. “We’re naturally anxious not to have to call in\\nScotland Yard. Raglan seems very sure of himself, but I’m not quite certain\\nthat I agree with him. You see, I—er—know the parties concerned better\\nthan he does. This fellow doesn’t seem out after kudos, does he? Would\\nwork in with us unobtrusively, eh?”\\n“To the greater glory of Inspector Raglan,” I said solemnly.\\n“Well, well,” said Colonel Melrose breezily in a louder voice, “we must\\nput you wise to the latest developments, M. Poirot.”\\n“I thank you,” said Poirot. “My friend, Doctor Sheppard, said\\nsomething of the butler being suspected?”\\n“That’s all bunkum,” said Raglan instantly. “These high-class servants\\nget in such a funk that they act suspiciously for nothing at all.”\\n“The fingerprints?” I hinted.\\n“Nothing like Parker’s.” He gave a faint smile, and added: “And yours\\nand Mr. Raymond’s don’t fit either, doctor.”\\n“What about those of Captain Ralph Paton?” asked Poirot quietly.\\nI felt a secret admiration of the way he took the bull by the horns. I saw\\na look of respect creep into the inspector’s eye.\\n“I see you don’t let the grass grow under your feet, Mr. Poirot. It will be\\na pleasure to work with you, I’m sure. We’re going to take that young\\ngentleman’s fingerprints as soon as we can lay hands upon him.”\\n“I can’t help thinking you’re mistaken, Inspector,” said Colonel Melrose\\nwarmly. “I’ve known Ralph Paton from a boy upward. He’d never stoop to\\nmurder.”\\n“Maybe not,” said the inspector tonelessly.\\n“What have you got against him?” I asked.\\n“Went out just on nine o’clock last night. Was seen in the\\nneighbourhood of Fernly Park somewhere about nine-thirty. Not been seen\\nsince. Believed to be in serious money difficulties. I’ve got a pair of his\\nshoes here—shoes with rubber studs in them. He had two pairs, almost\\nexactly alike. I’m going up now to compare them with those footmarks. The\\nconstable is up there seeing that no one tampers with them.”\\n“We’ll go at once,” said Colonel Melrose. “You and M. Poirot will\\naccompany us, will you not?”\\nWe assented, and all drove up in the colonel’s car. The inspector was\\nanxious to get at once to the footmarks, and asked to be put down at the\\nlodge. About halfway up the drive, on the right, a path branched off which\\nled round to the terrace and the window of Ackroyd’s study.\\n“Would you like to go with the inspector, M. Poirot,” asked the chief\\nconstable, “or would you prefer to examine the study?”\\nPoirot chose the latter alternative. Parker opened the door to us. His\\nmanner was smug and deferential, and he seemed to have recovered from\\nhis panic of the night before.\\nColonel Melrose took a key from his pocket, and unlocking the door\\nwhich let into the lobby, he ushered us through into the study.\\n“Except for the removal of the body, M. Poirot, this room is exactly as it\\nwas last night.”\\n“And the body was found—where?”\\nAs precisely as possible, I described Ackroyd’s position. The armchair\\nstill stood in front of the fire.\\nPoirot went and sat down in it.\\n“The blue letter you speak of, where was it when you left the room?”\\n“Mr. Ackroyd had laid it down on this little table at his right hand.”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“Except for that, everything was in its place?”\\n“Yes, I think so.”\\n“Colonel Melrose, would you be so extremely obliging as to sit down in\\nthis chair a minute. I thank you. Now M. le docteur, will you kindly indicate\\nto me the exact position of the dagger?”\\nI did so, whilst the little man stood in the doorway.\\n“The hilt of the dagger was plainly visible from the door then. Both you\\nand Parker could see it at once?”\\n“Yes.”\\nPoirot went next to the window.\\n“The electric light was on, of course, when you discovered the body?”\\nhe asked over his shoulder.\\nI assented, and joined him where he was studying the marks on the\\nwindowsill.\\n“The rubber studs are the same pattern as those in Captain Paton’s\\nshoes,” he said quietly.\\nThen he came back once more to the middle of the room. His eye\\ntravelled round, searching everything in the room with a quick, trained\\nglance.\\n“Are you a man of good observation, Doctor Sheppard?” he asked at\\nlast.\\n“I think so,” I said, surprised.\\n“There was a fire in the grate, I see. When you broke the door down and\\nfound Mr. Ackroyd dead, how was the fire? Was it low?”\\nI gave a vexed laugh.\\n“I—I really can’t say. I didn’t notice. Perhaps Mr. Raymond or Major\\nBlunt—”\\nThe little man opposite me shook his head with a faint smile.\\n“One must always proceed with method. I made an error of judgment in\\nasking you that question. To each man his own knowledge. You could tell\\nme the details of the patient’s appearance—nothing there would escape you.\\nIf I wanted information about the papers on that desk, Mr. Raymond would\\nhave noticed anything there was to see. To find out about the fire, I must\\nask the man whose business it is to observe such things. You permit—”\\nHe moved swiftly to the fireplace and rang the bell.\\nAfter a lapse of a minute or two Parker appeared.\\n“The bell rang, sir,” he said hesitatingly.\\n“Come in, Parker,” said Colonel Melrose. “This gentleman wants to ask\\nyou something.”\\nParker transferred a respectful attention to Poirot.\\n“Parker,” said the little man, “when you broke down the door with Dr.\\nSheppard last night, and found your master dead, what was the state of the\\nfire?”\\nParker replied without a pause.\\n“It had burned very low, sir. It was almost out.”\\n“Ah!” said Poirot. The exclamation sounded almost triumphant. He\\nwent on:\\n“Look round you, my good Parker. Is this room exactly as it was then?”\\nThe butler’s eye swept round. It came to rest on the windows.\\n“The curtains were drawn, sir, and the electric light was on.”\\nPoirot nodded approval.\\n“Anything else?”\\n“Yes, sir, this chair was drawn out a little more.”\\nHe indicated a big grandfather chair to the left of the door between it\\nand the window. I append a plan of the room with the chair in question\\nmarked with an X.\\n“Just show me,” said Poirot.\\nThe butler drew the chair in question out a good two feet from the wall,\\nturning it so that the seat faced the door.\\n“Voilà ce qui est curieux,” murmured Poirot. “No one would want to sit\\nin a chair in such a position, I fancy. Now who pushed it back into place\\nagain, I wonder? Did you, my friend?”\\n“No, sir,” said Parker. “I was too upset with seeing the master and all.”\\nPoirot looked across at me.\\n“Did you, doctor?”\\nI shook my head.\\n“It was back in position when I arrived with the police, sir,” put in\\nParker. “I’m sure of that.”\\n“Curious,” said Poirot again.\\n“Raymond or Blunt must have pushed it back,” I suggested. “Surely it\\nisn’t important?”\\n“It is completely unimportant,” said Poirot. “That is why it is so\\ninteresting,” he added softly.\\n“Excuse me a minute,” said Colonel Melrose. He left the room with\\nParker.\\n“Do you think Parker is speaking the truth?” I asked.\\n“About the chair, yes. Otherwise I do not know. You will find, M. le\\ndocteur, if you have much to do with cases of this kind, that they all\\nresemble each other in one thing.”\\n“What is that?” I asked curiously.\\n“Everyone concerned in them has something to hide.”\\n“Have I?” I asked, smiling.\\nPoirot looked at me attentively.\\n“I think you have,” he said quietly.\\n“But—”\\n“Have you told me everything known to you about this young man\\nPaton?” He smiled as I grew red. “Oh! do not fear. I will not press you. I\\nshall learn it in good time.”\\n“I wish you’d tell me something of your methods,” I said hastily, to\\ncover my confusion. “The point about the fire, for instance?”\\n“Oh! that was very simple. You leave Mr. Ackroyd at—ten minutes to\\nnine, was it not?”\\n“Yes, exactly, I should say.”\\n“The window is then closed and bolted and the door unlocked. At a\\nquarter past ten when the body is discovered, the door is locked and the\\nwindow is open. Who opened it? Clearly only Mr. Ackroyd himself could\\nhave done so, and for one of two reasons. Either because the room became\\nunbearably hot, but since the fire was nearly out and there was a sharp drop\\nin temperature last night, that cannot be the reason, or because he admitted\\nsomeone that way. And if he admitted someone that way, it must have been\\nsomeone well known to him, since he had previously shown himself uneasy\\non the subject of that same window.”\\n“It sounds very simple,” I said.\\n“Everything is simple, if you arrange the facts methodically. We are\\nconcerned now with the personality of the person who was with him at\\nnine-thirty last night. Everything goes to show that that was the individual\\nadmitted by the window, and though Mr. Ackroyd was seen alive later by\\nMiss Flora, we cannot approach a solution of the mystery until we know\\nwho that visitor was. The window may have been left open after his\\ndeparture and so afforded entrance to the murderer, or the same person may\\nhave returned a second time. Ah! here is the colonel who returns.”\\nColonel Melrose entered with an animated manner.\\n“That telephone call has been traced at last,” he said. “It did not come\\nfrom here. It was put through to Dr. Sheppard at 10:15 last night from a\\npublic call office at King’s Abbot station. And at 10:23 the night mail\\nleaves for Liverpool.”\\nEight\\nINSPECTOR RAGLAN IS CONFIDENT\\nWe looked at each other.\\n“You’ll have inquiries made at the station, of course?” I said.\\n“Naturally, but I’m not over sanguine as to the result. You know what\\nthat station is like.”\\nI did. King’s Abbot is a mere village, but its station happens to be an\\nimportant junction. Most of the big expresses stop there, and trains are\\nshunted, re-sorted, and made up. It has two or three public telephone boxes.\\nAt that time of night, three local trains come in close upon each other, to\\ncatch the connection with the express for the north which comes in at 10:19\\nand leaves at 10:23. The whole place is in a bustle, and the chances of one\\nparticular person being noticed telephoning or getting into the express are\\nvery small indeed.\\n“But why telephone at all?” demanded Melrose. “That is what I find so\\nextraordinary. There seems no rhyme or reason in the thing.”\\nPoirot carefully straightened a china ornament on one of the bookcases.\\n“Be sure there was a reason,” he said over his shoulder.\\n“But what reason could it be?”\\n“When we know that, we shall know everything. This case is very\\ncurious and very interesting.”\\nThere was something almost indescribable in the way he said those last\\nwords. I felt that he was looking at the case from some peculiar angle of his\\nown, and what he saw I could not tell.\\nHe went to the window and stood there, looking out.\\n“You say it was nine o’clock, Dr. Sheppard, when you met this stranger\\noutside the gate?”\\nHe asked the question without turning round.\\n“Yes,” I replied. “I heard the church clock chime the hour.”\\n“How long would it take him to reach the house—to reach this window,\\nfor instance?”\\n“Five minutes at the outside. Two or three minutes only if he took the\\npath at the right of the drive and came straight here.”\\n“But to do that he would have to know the way. How can I explain\\nmyself?—it would mean that he had been here before—that he knew his\\nsurroundings.”\\n“That is true,” replied Colonel Melrose.\\n“We could find out, doubtless, if Mr. Ackroyd had received any\\nstrangers during the past week?”\\n“Young Raymond could tell us that,” I said.\\n“Or Parker,” suggested Colonel Melrose.\\n“Ou tous les deux,” suggested Poirot, smiling.\\nColonel Melrose went in search of Raymond, and I rang the bell once\\nmore for Parker.\\nColonel Melrose returned almost immediately, accompanied by the\\nyoung secretary, whom he introduced to Poirot. Geoffrey Raymond was\\nfresh and debonair as ever. He seemed surprised and delighted to make\\nPoirot’s acquaintance.\\n“No idea you’d been living among us incognito, M. Poirot,” he said. “It\\nwill be a great privilege to watch you at work—Hallo, what’s this?”\\nPoirot had been standing just to the left of the door. Now he moved\\naside suddenly, and I saw that while my back was turned he must have\\nswiftly drawn out the armchair till it stood in the position Parker had\\nindicated.\\n“Want me to sit in the chair whilst you take a blood test?” asked\\nRaymond good-humouredly. “What’s the idea?”\\n“M. Raymond, this chair was pulled out—so—last night when Mr.\\nAckroyd was found killed. Someone moved it back again into place. Did\\nyou do so?”\\nThe secretary’s reply came without a second’s hesitation.\\n“No, indeed I didn’t. I don’t even remember that it was in that position,\\nbut it must have been if you say so. Anyway, somebody else must have\\nmoved it back to its proper place. Have they destroyed a clue in doing so?\\nToo bad!”\\n“It is of no consequence,” said the detective. “Of no consequence\\nwhatever. What I really want to ask you is this, M. Raymond: Did any\\nstranger come to see Mr. Ackroyd during this past week?”\\nThe secretary reflected for a minute or two, knitting his brows, and\\nduring the pause Parker appeared in answer to the bell.\\n“No,” said Raymond at last. “I can’t remember anyone. Can you,\\nParker?”\\n“I beg your pardon, sir?”\\n“Any stranger coming to see Mr. Ackroyd this week?”\\nThe butler reflected for a minute or two.\\n“There was the young man who came on Wednesday, sir,” he said at\\nlast. “From Curtis and Troute, I understood he was.”\\nRaymond moved this aside with an impatient hand.\\n“Oh! yes, I remember, but that is not the kind of stranger this gentleman\\nmeans.” He turned to Poirot. “Mr. Ackroyd had some idea of purchasing a\\ndictaphone,” he explained. “It would have enabled us to get through a lot\\nmore work in a limited time. The firm in question sent down their\\nrepresentative, but nothing came of it. Mr. Ackroyd did not make up his\\nmind to purchase.”\\nPoirot turned to the butler.\\n“Can you describe this young man to me, my good Parker?”\\n“He was fair-haired, sir, and short. Very neatly dressed in a blue serge\\nsuit. A very presentable young man, sir, for his station in life.”\\nPoirot turned to me.\\n“The man you met outside the gate, doctor, was tall, was he not?”\\n“Yes,” I said. “Somewhere about six feet, I should say.”\\n“There is nothing in that, then,” declared the Belgian. “I thank you,\\nParker.”\\nThe butler spoke to Raymond.\\n“Mr. Hammond has just arrived, sir,” he said. “He is anxious to know if\\nhe can be of any service, and he would be glad to have a word with you.”\\n“I’ll come at once,” said the young man. He hurried out. Poirot looked\\ninquiringly at the chief constable.\\n“The family solicitor, M. Poirot,” said the latter.\\n“It is a busy time for this young M. Raymond,” murmured M. Poirot.\\n“He has the air efficient, that one.”\\n“I believe Mr. Ackroyd considered him a most able secretary.”\\n“He has been here—how long?”\\n“Just on two years, I fancy.”\\n“His duties he fulfils punctiliously. Of that I am sure. In what manner\\ndoes he amuse himself? Does he go in for le sport?”\\n“Private secretaries haven’t much time for that sort of thing,” said\\nColonel Melrose, smiling. “Raymond plays golf, I believe. And tennis in\\nthe summer time.”\\n“He does not attend the courses—I should say the running of the\\nhorses?”\\n“Race meetings? No, I don’t think he’s interested in racing.”\\nPoirot nodded and seemed to lose interest. He glanced slowly round the\\nstudy.\\n“I have seen, I think, all that there is to be seen here.”\\nI, too, looked round.\\n“If those walls could speak,” I murmured.\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n“A tongue is not enough,” he said. “They would have to have also eyes\\nand ears. But do not be too sure that these dead things”—he touched the top\\nof the bookcase as he spoke—“are always dumb. To me they speak\\nsometimes—chairs, tables—they have their message!”\\nHe turned away towards the door.\\n“What message?” I cried. “What have they said to you today?”\\nHe looked over his shoulder and raised one eyebrow quizzically.\\n“An opened window,” he said. “A locked door. A chair that apparently\\nmoved itself. To all three I say ‘Why?’ and I find no answer.”\\nHe shook his head, puffed out his chest, and stood blinking at us. He\\nlooked ridiculously full of his own importance. It crossed my mind to\\nwonder whether he was really any good as a detective. Had his big\\nreputation been built up on a series of lucky chances?\\nI think the same thought must have occurred to Colonel Melrose, for he\\nfrowned.\\n“Anything more you want to see, M. Poirot?” he inquired brusquely.\\n“You would perhaps be so kind as to show me the silver table from\\nwhich the weapon was taken? After that, I will trespass on your kindness no\\nlonger.”\\nWe went to the drawing room, but on the way the constable waylaid the\\ncolonel, and after a muttered conversation the latter excused himself and\\nleft us together. I showed Poirot the silver table, and after raising the lid\\nonce or twice and letting it fall, he pushed open the window and stepped out\\non the terrace. I followed him.\\nInspector Raglan had just turned the corner of the house, and was\\ncoming towards us. His face looked grim and satisfied.\\n“So there you are, M. Poirot,” he said. “Well, this isn’t going to be\\nmuch of a case. I’m sorry, too. A nice enough young fellow gone wrong.”\\nPoirot’s face fell, and he spoke very mildly.\\n“I’m afraid I shall not be able to be of much aid to you, then?”\\n“Next time, perhaps,” said the inspector soothingly. “Though we don’t\\nhave murders every day in this quiet little corner of the world.”\\nPoirot’s gaze took on an admiring quality.\\n“You have been of a marvellous promptness,” he observed. “How\\nexactly did you go to work, if I may ask?”\\n“Certainly,” said the inspector. “To begin with—method. That’s what I\\nalways say—method!”\\n“Ah!” cried the other. “That, too, is my watchword. Method, order, and\\nthe little grey cells.”\\n“The cells?” said the inspector, staring.\\n“The little grey cells of the brain,” explained the Belgian.\\n“Oh, of course; well, we all use them, I suppose.”\\n“In a greater or lesser degree,” murmured Poirot. “And there are, too,\\ndifferences in quality. Then there is the psychology of a crime. One must\\nstudy that.”\\n“Ah!” said the inspector, “you’ve been bitten with all this psychoanalysis stuff? Now, I’m a plain man—”\\n“Mrs. Raglan would not agree, I am sure, to that,” said Poirot, making\\nhim a little bow.\\nInspector Raglan, a little taken aback, bowed.\\n“You don’t understand,” he said, grinning broadly. “Lord, what a lot of\\ndifference language makes. I’m telling you how I set to work. First of all,\\nmethod. Mr. Ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by his niece,\\nMiss Flora Ackroyd. That’s fact number one, isn’t it?”\\n“If you say so.”\\n“Well, it is. At half past ten, the doctor here says that Mr. Ackroyd had\\nbeen dead at least half an hour. You stick to that, doctor?”\\n“Certainly,” I said. “Half an hour or longer.”\\n“Very good. That gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the\\ncrime must have been committed. I make a list of everyone in the house,\\nand work through it, setting down opposite their names where they were\\nand what they were doing between the hour of 9:45 and 10 p.m.”\\nHe handed a sheet of paper to Poirot. I read it over his shoulder. It ran as\\nfollows, written in a neat script:\\nMajor Blunt In billiard room with Mr. Raymond. (Latter confirms.)\\nMr. Raymond Billiard room. (See above.)\\nMrs. Ackroyd 9:45 watching billiard match. Went up to bed 9:55.\\n(Raymond and Blunt watched her up staircase.)\\nMiss Ackroyd Went straight from her uncle’s room upstairs. (Confirmed by\\nParker, also housemaid, Elsie Dale.)\\nServants:\\nParker Went straight to butler’s pantry. (Confirmed by housekeeper, Miss\\nRussell, who came down to speak to him about something at 9:47, and\\nremained at least ten minutes.)\\nMiss Russell As above. Spoke to housemaid, Elsie Dale, upstairs at 9:45.\\nUrsula Bourne (parlourmaid) In her own room until 9:55. Then in\\nServants’ Hall.\\nMrs. Cooper (cook) In Servants’ Hall.\\nGladys Jones (second housemaid) In Servants’ Hall.\\nElsie Dale Upstairs in bedroom. Seen there by Miss Russell and Miss Flora\\nAckroyd.\\nMary Thripp (kitchenmaid) Servants’ Hall.\\n“The cook has been here seven years, the parlourmaid eighteen months, and\\nParker just over a year. The others are new. Except for something fishy\\nabout Parker, they all seem quite all right.”\\n“A very complete list,” said Poirot, handing it back to him. “I am quite\\nsure that Parker did not do the murder,” he added gravely.\\n“So is my sister,” I struck in. “And she’s usually right.” Nobody paid\\nany attention to my interpolation.\\n“That disposes pretty effectually of the household,” continued the\\ninspector. “Now we come to a very grave point. The woman at the lodge—\\nMary Black—was pulling the curtains last night when she saw Ralph Paton\\nturn in at the gate and go up towards the house.”\\n“She is sure of that?” I asked sharply.\\n“Quite sure. She knows him well by sight. He went past very quickly\\nand turned off by the path to the right, which is a short cut to the terrace.”\\n“And what time was that?” asked Poirot, who had sat with an\\nimmovable face.\\n“Exactly twenty-five minutes past nine,” said the inspector gravely.\\nThere was a silence. Then the inspector spoke again.\\n“It’s all clear enough. It fits in without a flaw. At twenty-five minutes\\npast nine, Captain Paton is seen passing the lodge; at nine-thirty or\\nthereabouts, Mr. Geoffrey Raymond hears someone in here asking for\\nmoney and Mr. Ackroyd refusing. What happens next? Captain Paton\\nleaves the same way—through the window. He walks along the terrace,\\nangry and baffled. He comes to the open drawing room window. Say it’s\\nnow a quarter to ten. Miss Flora Ackroyd is saying goodnight to her uncle.\\nMajor Blunt, Mr. Raymond, and Mrs. Ackroyd are in the billiard room. The\\ndrawing room is empty. He steals in, takes the dagger from the silver table,\\nand returns to the study window. He slips off his shoes, climbs in, and—\\nwell, I don’t need to go into details. Then he slips out again and goes off.\\nHadn’t the nerve to go back to the inn. He makes for the station, rings up\\nfrom there—”\\n“Why?” said Poirot softly.\\nI jumped at the interruption. The little man was leaning forward. His\\neyes shone with a queer green light.\\nFor a moment Inspector Raglan was taken aback by the question.\\n“It’s difficult to say exactly why he did that,” he said at last. “But\\nmurderers do funny things. You’d know that if you were in the police force.\\nThe cleverest of them make stupid mistakes sometimes. But come along\\nand I’ll show you those footprints.”\\nWe followed him round the corner of the terrace to the study window.\\nAt a word from Raglan a police constable produced the shoes which had\\nbeen obtained from the local inn.\\nThe inspector laid them over the marks.\\n“They’re the same,” he said confidently. “That is to say, they’re not the\\nsame pair that actually made these prints. He went away in those. This is a\\npair just like them, but older—see how the studs are worn down?”\\n“Surely a great many people wear shoes with rubber studs in them?”\\nasked Poirot.\\n“That’s so, of course,” said the inspector. “I shouldn’t put so much\\nstress on the footmarks if it wasn’t for everything else.”\\n“A very foolish young man, Captain Ralph Paton,” said Poirot\\nthoughtfully. “To leave so much evidence of his presence.”\\n“Ah! well,” said the inspector, “it was a dry, fine night, you know. He\\nleft no prints on the terrace or on the gravelled path. But, unluckily for him,\\na spring must have welled up just lately at the end of the path from the\\ndrive. See here.”\\nA small gravelled path joined the terrace a few feet away. In one spot, a\\nfew yards from its termination, the ground was wet and boggy. Crossing\\nthis wet place there were again the marks of footsteps, and amongst them\\nthe shoes with rubber studs.\\nPoirot followed the path on a little way, the inspector by his side.\\n“You noticed the women’s footprints?” he said suddenly.\\nThe inspector laughed.\\n“Naturally. But several different women have walked this way—and\\nmen as well. It’s a regular short cut to the house, you see. It would be\\nimpossible to sort out all the footsteps. After all, it’s the ones on the\\nwindowsill that are really important.”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“It’s no good going farther,” said the inspector, as we came in view of\\nthe drive. “It’s all gravelled again here, and hard as it can be.”\\nAgain Poirot nodded, but his eyes were fixed on a small garden house—\\na kind of superior summerhouse. It was a little to the left of the path ahead\\nof us, and a gravelled walk ran up to it.\\nPoirot lingered about until the inspector had gone back towards the\\nhouse. Then he looked at me.\\n“You must have indeed been sent from the good God to replace my\\nfriend Hastings,” he said, with a twinkle. “I observe that you do not quit my\\nside. How say you, Doctor Sheppard, shall we investigate that\\nsummerhouse? It interests me.”\\nHe went up to the door and opened it. Inside, the place was almost dark.\\nThere were one or two rustic seats, a croquet set, and some folded deck\\nchairs.\\nI was startled to observe my new friend. He had dropped to his hands\\nand knees and was crawling about the floor. Every now and then he shook\\nhis head as though not satisfied. Finally, he sat back on his heels.\\n“Nothing,” he murmured. “Well, perhaps it was not to be expected. But\\nit would have meant so much—”\\nHe broke off, stiffening all over. Then he stretched out his hand to one\\nof the rustic chairs. He detached something from one side of it.\\n“What is it?” I cried. “What have you found?”\\nHe smiled, unclosing his hand so that I should see what lay in the palm\\nof it. A scrap of stiff white cambric.\\nI took it from him, looked at it curiously, and then handed it back.\\n“What do you make of it, eh, my friend?” he asked, eyeing me keenly.\\n“A scrap torn from a handkerchief,” I suggested, shrugging my\\nshoulders.\\nHe made another dart and picked up a small quill—a goose quill by the\\nlook of it.\\n“And that?” he cried triumphantly. “What do you make of that?”\\nI only stared.\\nHe slipped the quill into his pocket, and looked again at the scrap of\\nwhite stuff.\\n“A fragment of a handkerchief?” he mused. “Perhaps you are right. But\\nremember this—a good laundry does not starch a handkerchief.”\\nHe nodded at me triumphantly, then he put away the scrap carefully in\\nhis pocketbook.\\nNine\\nTHE GOLDFISH POND\\nWe walked back to the house together. There was no sign of the inspector.\\nPoirot paused on the terrace and stood with his back to the house, slowly\\nturning his head from side to side.\\n“Une belle propriété,” he said at last appreciatively. “Who inherits it?”\\nHis words gave me almost a shock. It is an odd thing, but until that\\nmoment the question of inheritance had never come into my head. Poirot\\nwatched me keenly.\\n“It is a new idea to you, that,” he said at last. “You had not thought of it\\nbefore—eh?”\\n“No,” I said truthfully. “I wish I had.”\\nHe looked at me again curiously.\\n“I wonder just what you mean by that,” he said thoughtfully. “Oh! no,”\\nas I was about to speak. “Inutile! You would not tell me your real thought.”\\n“Everyone has something to hide,” I quoted, smiling.\\n“Exactly.”\\n“You still believe that?”\\n“More than ever, my friend. But it is not easy to hide things from\\nHercule Poirot. He has a knack of finding out.”\\nHe descended the steps of the Dutch garden as he spoke.\\n“Let us walk a little,” he said over his shoulder. “The air is pleasant\\ntoday.”\\nI followed him. He led me down a path to the left enclosed in yew\\nhedges. A walk led down the middle, bordered each side with formal flower\\nbeds, and at the end was a round paved recess with a seat and a pond of\\ngoldfish. Instead of pursuing the path to the end, Poirot took another which\\nwound up the side of a wooded slope. In one spot the trees had been cleared\\naway, and a seat had been put. Sitting there one had a splendid view over\\nthe countryside, and one looked right down on the paved recess and the\\ngoldfish pond.\\n“England is very beautiful,” said Poirot, his eyes straying over the\\nprospect. Then he smiled. “And so are English girls,” he said in a lower\\nvoice. “Hush, my friend, and look at the pretty picture below us.”\\nIt was then that I saw Flora. She was moving along the path we had just\\nleft and she was humming a little snatch of song. Her step was more\\ndancing than walking, and, in spite of her black dress, there was nothing but\\njoy in her whole attitude. She gave a sudden pirouette on her toes, and her\\nblack draperies swung out. At the same time she flung her head back and\\nlaughed outright.\\nAs she did so a man stepped out from the trees. It was Hector Blunt.\\nThe girl started. Her expression changed a little.\\n“How you startled me—I didn’t see you.”\\nBlunt said nothing, but stood looking at her for a minute or two in\\nsilence.\\n“What I like about you,” said Flora, with a touch of malice, “is your\\ncheery conversation.”\\nI fancy that at that Blunt reddened under his tan. His voice, when he\\nspoke, sounded different—it had a curious sort of humility in it.\\n“Never was much of a fellow for talking. Not even when I was young.”\\n“That was a very long time ago, I suppose,” said Flora gravely.\\nI caught the undercurrent of laughter in her voice, but I don’t think\\nBlunt did.\\n“Yes,” he said simply, “it was.”\\n“How does it feel to be Methuselah?” asked Flora.\\nThis time the laughter was more apparent, but Blunt was following out\\nan idea of his own.\\n“Remember the johnny who sold his soul to the devil? In return for\\nbeing made young again? There’s an opera about it.”\\n“Faust, you mean?”\\n“That’s the beggar. Rum story. Some of us would do it if we could.”\\n“Anyone would think you were creaking at the joints to hear you talk,”\\ncried Flora, half vexed, half amused.\\nBlunt said nothing for a minute or two. Then he looked away from Flora\\ninto the middle distance and observed to an adjacent tree trunk that it was\\nabout time he got back to Africa.\\n“Are you going on another expedition—shooting things?”\\n“Expect so. Usually do, you know—shoot things, I mean.”\\n“You shot that head in the hall, didn’t you?”\\nBlunt nodded. Then he jerked out, going rather red as he did so:\\n“Care for some decent skins any time? If so, I could get ’em for you.”\\n“Oh! please do,” cried Flora. “Will you really? You won’t forget?”\\n“I shan’t forget,” said Hector Blunt.\\nHe added, in a sudden burst of communicativeness:\\n“Time I went. I’m no good in this sort of life. Haven’t got the manners\\nfor it. I’m a rough fellow, no use in society. Never remember the things\\none’s expected to say. Yes, time I went.”\\n“But you’re not going at once,” cried Flora. “No—not while we’re in all\\nthis trouble. Oh! please. If you go—”\\nShe turned away a little.\\n“You want me to stay?” asked Blunt.\\nHe spoke deliberately but quite simply.\\n“We all—”\\n“I meant you personally,” said Blunt, with directness.\\nFlora turned slowly back again and met his eyes.\\n“I want you to stay,” she said, “if—if that makes any difference.”\\n“It makes all the difference,” said Blunt.\\nThere was a moment’s silence. They sat down on the stone seat by the\\ngoldfish pond. It seemed as though neither of them knew quite what to say\\nnext.\\n“It—it’s such a lovely morning,” said Flora at last. “You know, I can’t\\nhelp feeling happy, in spite—in spite of everything. That’s awful, I\\nsuppose?”\\n“Quite natural,” said Blunt. “Never saw your uncle until two years ago,\\ndid you? Can’t be expected to grieve very much. Much better to have no\\nhumbug about it.”\\n“There’s something awfully consoling about you,” said Flora. “You\\nmake things seem so simple.”\\n“Things are simple as a rule,” said the big-game hunter.\\n“Not always,” said Flora.\\nHer voice had lowered itself, and I saw Blunt turn and look at her,\\nbringing his eyes back from (apparently) the coast of Africa to do so. He\\nevidently put his own construction on her change of tone, for he said, after a\\nminute or two, in rather an abrupt manner:\\n“I say, you know, you mustn’t worry. About that young chap, I mean.\\nInspector’s an ass. Everybody knows—utterly absurd to think he could have\\ndone it. Man from outside. Burglar chap. That’s the only possible solution.”\\nFlora turned to look at him.\\n“You really think so?”\\n“Don’t you?” said Blunt quickly.\\n“I—oh, yes, of course.”\\nAnother silence, and then Flora burst out:\\n“I’m—I’ll tell you why I felt so happy this morning. However heartless\\nyou think me, I’d rather tell you. It’s because the lawyer has been—Mr.\\nHammond. He told us about the will. Uncle Roger has left me twenty\\nthousand pounds. Think of it—twenty thousand beautiful pounds.”\\nBlunt looked surprised.\\n“Does it mean so much to you?”\\n“Mean much to me? Why, it’s everything. Freedom—life—no more\\nscheming and scraping and lying—”\\n“Lying?” said Blunt, sharply interrupting.\\nFlora seemed taken aback for a minute.\\n“You know what I mean,” she said uncertainly. “Pretending to be\\nthankful for all the nasty cast-off things rich relations give you. Last year’s\\ncoat and skirts and hats.”\\n“Don’t know much about ladies’ clothes; should have said you were\\nalways very well turned out.”\\n“It cost me something, though,” said Flora in a low voice. “Don’t let’s\\ntalk of horrid things. I’m so happy. I’m free. Free to do what I like. Free not\\nto—”\\nShe stopped suddenly.\\n“Not to what?” asked Blunt quickly.\\n“I forget now. Nothing important.”\\nBlunt had a stick in his hand, and he thrust it into the pond, poking at\\nsomething.\\n“What are you doing, Major Blunt?”\\n“There’s something bright down there. Wondered what it was—looks\\nlike a gold brooch. Now I’ve stirred up the mud and it’s gone.”\\n“Perhaps it’s a crown,” suggested Flora. “Like the one Melisande saw in\\nthe water.”\\n“Melisande,” said Blunt reflectively—“she’s in an opera, isn’t she?”\\n“Yes, you seem to know a lot about operas.”\\n“People take me sometimes,” said Blunt sadly. “Funny idea of pleasure\\n—worse racket than the natives make with their tom-toms.”\\nFlora laughed.\\n“I remember Melisande,” continued Blunt, “married an old chap old\\nenough to be her father.”\\nHe threw a small piece of flint into the goldfish pond. Then, with a\\nchange of manner, he turned to Flora.\\n“Miss Ackroyd, can I do anything? About Paton, I mean. I know how\\ndreadfully anxious you must be.”\\n“Thank you,” said Flora in a cold voice. “There is really nothing to be\\ndone. Ralph will be all right. I’ve got hold of the most wonderful detective\\nin the world, and he’s going to find out all about it.”\\nFor some time I had felt uneasy as to our position. We were not exactly\\neavesdropping, since the two in the garden below had only to lift their\\nheads to see us. Nevertheless, I should have drawn attention to our presence\\nbefore now, had not my companion put a warning pressure on my arm.\\nClearly he wished me to remain silent. Now, however, he acted briskly.\\nHe rose quickly to his feet, clearing his throat.\\n“I demand pardon,” he cried. “I cannot allow mademoiselle thus\\nextravagantly to compliment me, and not draw attention to my presence.\\nThey say the listener hears no good of himself, but that is not the case this\\ntime. To spare my blushes, I must join you and apologize.”\\nHe hurried down the path with me close behind him, and joined the\\nothers by the pond.\\n“This is M. Hercule Poirot,” said Flora. “I expect you’ve heard of him.”\\nPoirot bowed.\\n“I know Major Blunt by reputation,” he said politely. “I am glad to have\\nencountered you, monsieur. I am in need of some information that you can\\ngive me.”\\nBlunt looked at him inquiringly.\\n“When did you last see M. Ackroyd alive?”\\n“At dinner.”\\n“And you neither saw nor heard anything of him after that?”\\n“Didn’t see him. Heard his voice.”\\n“How was that?”\\n“I strolled out on the terrace—”\\n“Pardon me, what time was that?”\\n“About half past nine. I was walking up and down smoking in front of\\nthe drawing room window. I heard Ackroyd talking in his study—”\\nPoirot stopped and removed a microscopic weed.\\n“Surely you couldn’t hear voices in the study from that part of the\\nterrace,” he murmured.\\nHe was not looking at Blunt, but I was, and to my intense surprise, I\\nsaw the latter flush.\\n“Went as far as the corner,” he explained unwillingly.\\n“Ah! indeed?” said Poirot.\\nIn the mildest manner he conveyed an impression that more was\\nwanted.\\n“Thought I saw—a woman disappearing into the bushes. Just a gleam of\\nwhite, you know. Must have been mistaken. It was while I was standing at\\nthe corner of the terrace that I heard Ackroyd’s voice speaking to that\\nsecretary of his.”\\n“Speaking to Mr. Geoffrey Raymond?”\\n“Yes—that’s what I supposed at the time. Seems I was wrong.”\\n“Mr. Ackroyd didn’t address him by name?”\\n“Oh, no.”\\n“Then, if I may ask, why did you think—?”\\nBlunt explained laboriously.\\n“Took it for granted that it would be Raymond, because he had said just\\nbefore I came out that he was taking some papers to Ackroyd. Never\\nthought of it being anybody else.”\\n“Can you remember what the words you heard were?”\\n“Afraid I can’t. Something quite ordinary and unimportant. Only caught\\na scrap of it. I was thinking of something else at the time.”\\n“It is of no importance,” murmured Poirot. “Did you move a chair back\\nagainst the wall when you went into the study after the body was\\ndiscovered?”\\n“Chair? No, why should I?”\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders but did not answer. He turned to Flora.\\n“There is one thing I should like to know from you, mademoiselle.\\nWhen you were examining the things in the silver table with Dr. Sheppard,\\nwas the dagger in its place, or was it not?”\\nFlora’s chin shot up.\\n“Inspector Raglan has been asking me that,” she said resentfully. “I’ve\\ntold him, and I’ll tell you. I’m perfectly certain the dagger was not there. He\\nthinks it was and that Ralph sneaked it later in the evening. And—and he\\ndoesn’t believe me. He thinks I’m saying it so—to shield Ralph.”\\n“And aren’t you?” I asked gravely.\\nFlora stamped her foot.\\n“You, too, Dr. Sheppard! Oh! it’s too bad.”\\nPoirot tactfully made a diversion.\\n“It is true what I heard you say, Major Blunt. There is something that\\nglitters in this pond. Let us see if I can reach it.”\\nHe knelt down by the pond, baring his arm to the elbow, and lowered it\\nin very slowly, so as not to disturb the bottom of the pond. But in spite of all\\nhis precautions the mud eddied and swirled, and he was forced to draw his\\narm out again empty-handed.\\nHe gazed ruefully at the mud upon his arm. I offered him my\\nhandkerchief, which he accepted with fervent protestations of thanks. Blunt\\nlooked at his watch.\\n“Nearly lunch time,” he said. “We’d better be getting back to the\\nhouse.”\\n“You will lunch with us, M. Poirot?” asked Flora. “I should like you to\\nmeet my mother. She is—very fond of Ralph.”\\nThe little man bowed.\\n“I shall be delighted, mademoiselle.”\\n“And you will stay, too, won’t you, Dr. Sheppard?”\\nI hesitated.\\n“Oh, do!”\\nI wanted to, so I accepted the invitation without further ceremony.\\nWe set out towards the house, Flora and Blunt walking ahead.\\n“What hair,” said Poirot to me in a low tone, nodding towards Flora.\\n“The real gold! They will make a pretty couple. She and the dark,\\nhandsome Captain Paton. Will they not?”\\nI looked at him inquiringly, but he began to fuss about a few\\nmicroscopic drops of water on his coat sleeve. The man reminded me in\\nsome ways of a cat. His green eyes and his finicking habits.\\n“And all for nothing, too,” I said sympathetically. “I wonder what it was\\nin the pond?”\\n“Would you like to see?” asked Poirot.\\nI stared at him. He nodded.\\n“My good friend,” he said gently and reproachfully, “Hercule Poirot\\ndoes not run the risk of disarranging his costume without being sure of\\nattaining his object. To do so would be ridiculous and absurd. I am never\\nridiculous.”\\n“But you brought your hand out empty,” I objected.\\n“There are times when it is necessary to have discretion. Do you tell\\nyour patients everything—but everything, doctor? I think not. Nor do you\\ntell your excellent sister everything either, is it not so? Before showing my\\nempty hand, I dropped what it contained into my other hand. You shall see\\nwhat that was.”\\nHe held out his left hand, palm open. On it lay a little circlet of gold. A\\nwoman’s wedding ring.\\nI took it from him.\\n“Look inside,” commanded Poirot.\\nI did so. Inside was an inscription in fine writing:\\nFrom R., March 13th.\\nI looked at Poirot, but he was busy inspecting his appearance in a tiny\\npocket glass. He paid particular attention to his moustaches, and none at all\\nto me. I saw that he did not intend to be communicative.\\nTen\\nTHE PARLOURMAID\\nWe found Mrs. Ackroyd in the hall. With her was a small dried-up little\\nman, with an aggressive chin and sharp grey eyes, and “lawyer” written all\\nover him.\\n“Mr. Hammond is staying to lunch with us,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “You\\nknow Major Blunt, Mr. Hammond? And dear Doctor Sheppard—also a\\nclose friend of poor Roger’s. And, let me see—”\\nShe paused, surveying Hercule Poirot in some perplexity.\\n“This is M. Poirot, Mother,” said Flora. “I told you about him this\\nmorning.”\\n“Oh! yes,” said Mrs. Ackroyd vaguely. “Of course, my dear, of course.\\nHe is to find Ralph, is he not?”\\n“He is to find out who killed Uncle,” said Flora.\\n“Oh! my dear,” cried her mother. “Please! My poor nerves. I am a\\nwreck this morning, a positive wreck. Such a dreadful thing to happen. I\\ncan’t help feeling that it must have been an accident of some kind. Roger\\nwas so fond of handling queer curios. His hand must have slipped, or\\nsomething.”\\nThis theory was received in polite silence. I saw Poirot edge up to the\\nlawyer, and speak to him in a confidential undertone. They moved aside\\ninto the embrasure of the window. I joined them—then hesitated.\\n“Perhaps I’m intruding,” I said.\\n“Not at all,” cried Poirot heartily. “You and I, M. le docteur, we\\ninvestigate this affair side by side. Without you I should be lost. I desire a\\nlittle information from the good Mr. Hammond.”\\n“You are acting on behalf of Captain Ralph Paton, I understand,” said\\nthe lawyer cautiously.\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n“Not so. I am acting in the interests of justice. Miss Ackroyd has asked\\nme to investigate the death of her uncle.”\\nMr. Hammond seemed slightly taken aback.\\n“I cannot seriously believe that Captain Paton can be concerned in this\\ncrime,” he said, “however strong the circumstantial evidence against him\\nmay be. The mere fact that he was hard pressed for money—”\\n“Was he hard pressed for money?” interpolated Poirot quickly.\\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\\n“It was a chronic condition with Ralph Paton,” he said drily. “Money\\nwent through his hands like water. He was always applying to his\\nstepfather.”\\n“Had he done so of late? During the last year, for instance?”\\n“I cannot say. Mr. Ackroyd did not mention the fact to me.”\\n“I comprehend. Mr. Hammond, I take it that you are acquainted with the\\nprovisions of Mr. Ackroyd’s will?”\\n“Certainly. That is my principal business here today.”\\n“Then, seeing that I am acting for Miss Ackroyd, you will not object to\\ntelling me the terms of that will?”\\n“They are quite simple. Shorn of legal phraseology, and after paying\\ncertain legacies and bequests—”\\n“Such as—?” interrupted Poirot.\\nMr. Hammond seemed a little surprised.\\n“A thousand pounds to his housekeeper, Miss Russell; fifty pounds to\\nthe cook, Emma Cooper; five hundred pounds to his secretary, Mr. Geoffrey\\nRaymond. Then to various hospitals—”\\nPoirot held up his hand.\\n“Ah! the charitable bequests, they interest me not.”\\n“Quite so. The income on ten thousand pounds” worth of shares to be\\npaid to Mrs. Cecil Ackroyd during her lifetime. Miss Flora Ackroyd inherits\\ntwenty thousand pounds outright. The residue—including this property, and\\nthe shares in Ackroyd and Son—to his adopted son, Ralph Paton.”\\n“Mr. Ackroyd possessed a large fortune?”\\n“A very large fortune. Captain Paton will be an exceedingly wealthy\\nyoung man.”\\nThere was a silence. Poirot and the lawyer looked at each other.\\n“Mr. Hammond,” came Mrs. Ackroyd’s voice plaintively from the\\nfireplace.\\nThe lawyer answered the summons. Poirot took my arm and drew me\\nright into the window.\\n“Regard the irises,” he remarked in a rather loud voice. “Magnificent,\\nare they not? A straight and pleasing effect.”\\nAt the same time I felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and he\\nadded in a low tone:\\n“Do you really wish to aid me? To take part in this investigation?”\\n“Yes, indeed,” I said eagerly. “There’s nothing I should like better. You\\ndon’t know what a dull old fogey’s life I lead. Never anything out of the\\nordinary.”\\n“Good, we will be colleagues then. In a minute or two I fancy Major\\nBlunt will join us. He is not happy with the good mamma. Now there are\\nsome things I want to know—but I do not wish to seem to want to know\\nthem. You comprehend? So it will be your part to ask the questions.”\\n“What questions do you want me to ask?” I asked apprehensively.\\n“I want you to introduce the name of Mrs. Ferrars.”\\n“Yes?”\\n“Speak of her in a natural fashion. Ask him if he was down here when\\nher husband died. You understand the kind of thing I mean. And while he\\nreplies, watch his face without seeming to watch it. C’est compris?”\\nThere was no time for more, for at that minute, as Poirot had\\nprophesied, Blunt left the others in his abrupt fashion and came over to us.\\nI suggested strolling on the terrace, and he acquiesced. Poirot stayed\\nbehind.\\nI stopped to examine a late rose.\\n“How things change in the course of a day or two,” I observed. “I was\\nup here last Wednesday, I remember, walking up and down this same\\nterrace. Ackroyd was with me—full of spirits. And now—three days later—\\nAckroyd’s dead, poor fellow. Mrs. Ferrars dead—you knew her, didn’t you?\\nBut of course you did.”\\nBlunt nodded his head.\\n“Had you seen her since you’d been down this time?”\\n“Went with Ackroyd to call. Last Tuesday, think it was. Fascinating\\nwoman—but something queer about her. Deep—one would never know\\nwhat she was up to.”\\nI looked into his steady grey eyes. Nothing there surely. I went on:\\n“I suppose you’d met her before?”\\n“Last time I was here—she and her husband had just come here to live.”\\nHe paused a minute and then added: “Rum thing, she had changed a lot\\nbetween then and now.”\\n“How—changed?” I asked.\\n“Looked ten years older.”\\n“Were you down here when her husband died?” I asked, trying to make\\nthe question sound as casual as possible.\\n“No. From all I heard it would be good riddance. Uncharitable, perhaps,\\nbut the truth.”\\nI agreed.\\n“Ashley Ferrars was by no means a pattern husband,” I said cautiously.\\n“Blackguard, I thought,” said Blunt.\\n“No,” I said, “only a man with more money than was good for him.”\\n“Oh! money! All the troubles in the world can be put down to money—\\nor the lack of it.”\\n“Which has been your particular trouble?” I asked.\\n“Enough for what I want. I’m one of the lucky ones.”\\n“Indeed.”\\n“I’m not too flush just now, as a matter of fact. Came into a legacy a\\nyear ago, and like a fool let myself be persuaded into putting it into some\\nwild-cat scheme.”\\nI sympathized, and narrated my own similar trouble.\\nThen the gong pealed out, and we all went in to lunch. Poirot drew me\\nback a little.\\n“Eh bien?”\\n“He’s all right,” I said. “I’m sure of it.”\\n“Nothing—disturbing?”\\n“He had a legacy just a year ago,” I said. “But why not? Why shouldn’t\\nhe? I’ll swear the man is perfectly square and above board.”\\n“Without doubt, without doubt,” said Poirot soothingly. “Do not upset\\nyourself.”\\nHe spoke as though to a fractious child.\\nWe all trooped into the dining room. It seemed incredible that less than\\ntwenty-four hours had passed since I last sat at that table.\\nAfterwards, Mrs. Ackroyd took me aside and sat down with me on a\\nsofa.\\n“I can’t help feeling a little hurt,” she murmured, producing a\\nhandkerchief of the kind obviously not meant to be cried into. “Hurt, I\\nmean, by Roger’s lack of confidence in me. That twenty thousand pounds\\nought to have been left to me—not to Flora. A mother could be trusted to\\nsafeguard the interests of her child. A lack of trust, I call it.”\\n“You forget, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “Flora was Ackroyd’s own niece, a\\nblood relation. It would have been different had you been his sister instead\\nof his sister-in-law.”\\n“As poor Cecil’s widow, I think my feelings ought to have been\\nconsidered,” said the lady, touching her eyelashes gingerly with the\\nhandkerchief. “But Roger was always most peculiar—not to say mean—\\nabout money matters. It has been a most difficult position for both Flora and\\nmyself. He did not even give the poor child an allowance. He would pay her\\nbills, you know, and even that with a good deal of reluctance and asking\\nwhat she wanted all those fal-lals for—so like a man—but—now I’ve\\nforgotten what it was I was going to say! Oh, yes, not a penny we could call\\nour own, you know. Flora resented it—yes, I must say she resented it—very\\nstrongly. Though devoted to her uncle, of course. But any girl would have\\nresented it. Yes, I must say Roger had very strange ideas about money. He\\nwouldn’t even buy new face towels, though I told him the old ones were in\\nholes. And then,” proceeded Mrs. Ackroyd, with a sudden leap highly\\ncharacteristic of her conversation, “to leave all that money—a thousand\\npounds, fancy, a thousand pounds!—to that woman.”\\n“What woman?”\\n“That Russell woman. Something very queer about her, and so I’ve\\nalways said. But Roger wouldn’t hear a word against her. Said she was a\\nwoman of great force of character, and that he admired and respected her.\\nHe was always going on about her rectitude and independence and moral\\nworth. I think there’s something fishy about her. She was certainly doing\\nher best to marry Roger. But I soon put a stop to that. She always hated me.\\nNaturally. I saw through her.”\\nI began to wonder if there was any chance of stemming Mrs. Ackroyd’s\\neloquence, and getting away.\\nMr. Hammond provided the necessary diversion by coming up to say\\ngoodbye. I seized my chance and rose also.\\n“About the inquest,” I said. “Where would you prefer it to be held?\\nHere, or at the Three Boars?”\\nMrs. Ackroyd stared at me with a dropped jaw.\\n“The inquest?” she asked, the picture of consternation. “But surely there\\nwon’t have to be an inquest?”\\nMr. Hammond gave a dry little cough and murmured, “Inevitable.\\nUnder the circumstances,” in two short little barks.\\n“But surely Dr. Sheppard can arrange—”\\n“There are limits to my powers of arrangement,” I said drily.\\n“If his death was an accident—”\\n“He was murdered, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said brutally.\\nShe gave a little cry.\\n“No theory of accident will hold water for a minute.”\\nMrs. Ackroyd looked at me in distress. I had no patience with what I\\nthought was her silly fear of unpleasantness.\\n“If there’s an inquest, I—I shan’t have to answer questions and all that,\\nshall I?” she asked.\\n“I don’t know what will be necessary,” I answered. “I imagine Mr.\\nRaymond will take the brunt of it off you. He knows all the circumstances,\\nand can give formal evidence of identification.”\\nThe lawyer assented with a little bow.\\n“I really don’t think there is anything to dread, Mrs. Ackroyd,” he said.\\n“You will be spared all the unpleasantness. Now, as to the question of\\nmoney, have you all you need for the present? I mean,” he added, as she\\nlooked at him inquiringly, “ready money. Cash, you know. If not, I can\\narrange to let you have whatever you require.”\\n“That ought to be all right,” said Raymond, who was standing by. “Mr.\\nAckroyd cashed a cheque for a hundred pounds yesterday.”\\n“A hundred pounds?”\\n“Yes. For wages and other expenses due today. At the moment it is still\\nintact.”\\n“Where is this money? In his desk?”\\n“No, he always kept his cash in his bedroom. In an old collar box, to be\\naccurate. Funny idea, wasn’t it?”\\n“I think,” said the lawyer, “we ought to make sure the money is there\\nbefore I leave.”\\n“Certainly,” agreed the secretary. “I’ll take you up now…Oh! I forgot.\\nThe door’s locked.”\\nInquiry from Parker elicited the information that Inspector Raglan was\\nin the housekeeper’s room asking a few supplementary questions. A few\\nminutes later the inspector joined the party in the hall, bringing the key with\\nhim. He unlocked the door and we passed into the lobby and up the small\\nstaircase. At the top of the stairs the door into Ackroyd’s bedroom stood\\nopen. Inside the room it was dark, the curtains were drawn, and the bed was\\nturned down just as it had been last night. The inspector drew the curtains,\\nletting in the sunlight, and Geoffrey Raymond went to the top drawer of a\\nrosewood bureau.\\n“He kept his money like that, in an unlocked drawer. Just fancy,”\\ncommented the inspector.\\nThe secretary flushed a little.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd had perfect faith in the honesty of all the servants,” he\\nsaid hotly.\\n“Oh! quite so,” said the inspector hastily.\\nRaymond opened the drawer, took out a round leather collar box from\\nthe back of it, and opening it, drew out a thick wallet.\\n“Here is the money,” he said, taking out a fat roll of notes. “You will\\nfind the hundred intact, I know, for Mr. Ackroyd put it in the collar box in\\nmy presence last night when he was dressing for dinner, and of course it has\\nnot been touched since.”\\nMr. Hammond took the roll from him and counted it. He looked up\\nsharply.\\n“A hundred pounds, you said. But there is only sixty here.”\\nRaymond stared at him.\\n“Impossible,” he cried, springing forward. Taking the notes from the\\nother’s hand, he counted them aloud.\\nMr. Hammond had been right. The total amounted to sixty pounds.\\n“But—I can’t understand it,” cried the secretary, bewildered.\\nPoirot asked a question.\\n“You saw Mr. Ackroyd put this money away last night when he was\\ndressing for dinner? You are sure he had not paid away any of it already?”\\n“I’m sure he hadn’t. He even said, ‘I don’t want to take a hundred\\npounds down to dinner with me. Too bulgy.’”\\n“Then the affair is very simple,” remarked Poirot. “Either he paid out\\nthat forty pounds some time last evening, or else it has been stolen.”\\n“That’s the matter in a nutshell,” agreed the inspector. He turned to Mrs.\\nAckroyd. “Which of the servants would come in here yesterday evening?”\\n“I suppose the housemaid would turn down the bed.”\\n“Who is she? What do you know about her?”\\n“She’s not been here very long,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “But she’s a nice\\nordinary country girl.”\\n“I think we ought to clear this matter up,” said the inspector. “If Mr.\\nAckroyd paid that money away himself, it may have a bearing on the\\nmystery of the crime. The other servants all right, as far as you know?”\\n“Oh, I think so.”\\n“Not missed anything before?”\\n“No.”\\n“None of them leaving, or anything like that?”\\n“The parlourmaid is leaving.”\\n“When?”\\n“She gave notice yesterday, I believe.”\\n“To you?”\\n“Oh, no. I have nothing to do with the servants. Miss Russell attends to\\nthe household matters.”\\nThe inspector remained lost in thought for a minute or two. Then he\\nnodded his head and remarked, “I think I’d better have a word with Miss\\nRussell, and I’ll see the girl Dale as well.”\\nPoirot and I accompanied him to the housekeeper’s room. Miss Russell\\nreceived us with her usual sangfroid.\\nElsie Dale had been at Fernly five months. A nice girl, quick at her\\nduties, and most respectable. Good references. The last girl in the world to\\ntake anything not belonging to her.\\nWhat about the parlourmaid?\\n“She, too, was a most superior girl. Very quiet and ladylike. An\\nexcellent worker.”\\n“Then why is she leaving?” asked the inspector.\\nMiss Russell pursed up her lips.\\n“It was none of my doing. I understand Mr. Ackroyd found fault with\\nher yesterday afternoon. It was her duty to do the study, and she disarranged\\nsome of the papers on his desk, I believe. He was very annoyed about it,\\nand she gave notice. At least, that is what I understood from her, but\\nperhaps you’d like to see her yourselves?”\\nThe inspector assented. I had already noticed the girl when she was\\nwaiting on us at lunch. A tall girl, with a lot of brown hair rolled tightly\\naway at the back of her neck, and very steady grey eyes. She came in\\nanswer to the housekeeper’s summons, and stood very straight with those\\nsame grey eyes fixed on us.\\n“You are Ursula Bourne?” asked the inspector.\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n“I understand you are leaving?”\\n“Yes, sir.”\\n“Why is that?”\\n“I disarranged some papers on Mr. Ackroyd’s desk. He was very angry\\nabout it, and I said I had better leave. He told me to go as soon as possible.”\\n“Were you in Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom at all last night? Tidying up or\\nanything?”\\n“No, sir. That is Elsie’s work. I never went near that part of the house.”\\n“I must tell you, my girl, that a large sum of money is missing from Mr.\\nAckroyd’s room.”\\nAt last I saw her roused. A wave of colour swept over her face.\\n“I know nothing about any money. If you think I took it, and that that is\\nwhy Mr. Ackroyd dismissed me, you are wrong.”\\n“I’m not accusing you of taking it, my girl,” said the inspector. “Don’t\\nflare up so.”\\nThe girl looked at him coldly.\\n“You can search my things if you like,” she said disdainfully. “But you\\nwon’t find anything.”\\nPoirot suddenly interposed.\\n“It was yesterday afternoon that Mr. Ackroyd dismissed you—or you\\ndismissed yourself, was it not?” he asked.\\nThe girl nodded.\\n“How long did the interview last?”\\n“The interview?”\\n“Yes, the interview between you and Mr. Ackroyd in the study?”\\n“I—I don’t know.”\\n“Twenty minutes? Half an hour?”\\n“Something like that.”\\n“Not longer?”\\n“Not longer than half an hour, certainly.”\\n“Thank you, mademoiselle.”\\nI looked curiously at him. He was rearranging a few objects on the\\ntable, setting them straight with precise fingers. His eyes were shining.\\n“That’ll do,” said the inspector.\\nUrsula Bourne disappeared. The inspector turned to Miss Russell.\\n“How long has she been here? Have you got a copy of the reference you\\nhad with her?”\\nWithout answering the first question, Miss Russell moved to an adjacent\\nbureau, opened one of the drawers, and took out a handful of letters clipped\\ntogether with a patent fastener. She selected one and handed it to the\\ninspector.\\n“H’m,” said he. “Reads all right. Mrs. Richard Folliott, Marby Grange,\\nMarby. Who’s this woman?”\\n“Quite good country people,” said Miss Russell.\\n“Well,” said the inspector, handing it back, “let’s have a look at the\\nother one, Elsie Dale.”\\nElsie Dale was a big fair girl, with a pleasant but slightly stupid face.\\nShe answered our questions readily enough, and showed much distress and\\nconcern at the loss of the money.\\n“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with her,” observed the inspector,\\nafter he had dismissed her. “What about Parker?”\\nMiss Russell pursed her lips together and made no reply.\\n“I’ve a feeling there’s something wrong about that man,” the inspector\\ncontinued thoughtfully. “The trouble is that I don’t quite see when he got\\nhis opportunity. He’d be busy with his duties immediately after dinner, and\\nhe’d got a pretty good alibi all through the evening. I know, for I’ve been\\ndevoting particular attention to it. Well, thank you very much, Miss Russell.\\nWe’ll leave things as they are for the present. It’s highly probable Mr.\\nAckroyd paid that money away himself.”\\nThe housekeeper bade us a dry good afternoon, and we took our leave.\\nI left the house with Poirot.\\n“I wonder,” I said, breaking the silence, “what the papers the girl\\ndisarranged could have been for Ackroyd to have got into such a state about\\nthem? I wonder if there is any clue there to the mystery.”\\n“The secretary said there were no papers of particular importance on the\\ndesk,” said Poirot quietly.\\n“Yes, but—” I paused.\\n“It strikes you as odd that Ackroyd should have flown into a rage about\\nso trivial a matter?”\\n“Yes, it does rather.”\\n“But was it a trivial matter?”\\n“Of course,” I admitted, “we don’t know what those papers may have\\nbeen. But Raymond certainly said—”\\n“Leave M. Raymond out of it for a minute. What did you think of that\\ngirl?”\\n“Which girl? The parlourmaid?”\\n“Yes, the parlourmaid. Ursula Bourne.”\\n“She seemed a nice girl,” I said hesitatingly.\\nPoirot repeated my words, but whereas I had laid a slight stress on the\\nfourth word, he put it on the second.\\n“She seemed a nice girl—yes.”\\nThen, after a minute’s silence, he took something from his pocket and\\nhanded it to me.\\n“See, my friend, I will show you something. Look there.”\\nThe paper he had handed me was that compiled by the inspector and\\ngiven by him to Poirot that morning. Following the pointing finger, I saw a\\nsmall cross marked in pencil opposite the name Ursula Bourne.\\n“You may not have noticed it at the time, my good friend, but there was\\none person on this list whose alibi had no kind of confirmation. Ursula\\nBourne.”\\n“You don’t think—?”\\n“Dr. Sheppard, I dare to think anything. Ursula Bourne may have killed\\nMr. Ackroyd, but I confess I can see no motive for her doing so. Can you?”\\nHe looked at me very hard—so hard that I felt uncomfortable.\\n“Can you?” he repeated.\\n“No motive whatsoever,” I said firmly.\\nHis gaze relaxed. He frowned and murmured to himself:\\n“Since the blackmailer was a man, it follows that she cannot be the\\nblackmailer, then—”\\nI coughed.\\n“As far as that goes—” I began doubtfully.\\nHe spun round on me.\\n“What? What are you going to say?”\\n“Nothing, Nothing. Only that, strictly speaking, Mrs. Ferrars in her\\nletter mentioned a person—she didn’t actually specify a man. But we took\\nit for granted, Ackroyd and I, that it was a man.”\\nPoirot did not seem to be listening to me. He was muttering to himself\\nagain.\\n“But then it is possible after all—yes, certainly it is possible—but then\\n—ah! I must rearrange my ideas. Method, order, never have I needed them\\nmore. Everything must fit in—in its appointed place—otherwise I am on\\nthe wrong track.”\\nHe broke off, and whirled round upon me again.\\n“Where is Marby?”\\n“It’s on the other side of Cranchester.”\\n“How far away?”\\n“Oh!—fourteen miles, perhaps.”\\n“Would it be possible for you to go there? Tomorrow, say?”\\n“Tomorrow? Let me see, that’s Sunday. Yes, I could arrange it. What do\\nyou want me to do there?”\\n“See this Mrs. Folliott. Find out all you can about Ursula Bourne.”\\n“Very well. But—I don’t much care for the job.”\\n“It is not the time to make difficulties. A man’s life may hang on this.”\\n“Poor Ralph,” I said with a sigh. “You believe him to be innocent,\\nthough?”\\nPoirot looked at me very gravely.\\n“Do you want to know the truth?”\\n“Of course.”\\n“Then you shall have it. My friend, everything points to the assumption\\nthat he is guilty.”\\n“What!” I exclaimed.\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“Yes, that stupid inspector—for he is stupid—has everything pointing\\nhis way. I seek for the truth—and the truth leads me every time to Ralph\\nPaton. Motive, opportunity, means. But I will leave no stone unturned. I\\npromised Mademoiselle Flora. And she was very sure, that little one. But\\nvery sure indeed.”\\nEleven\\nPOIROT PAYS A CALL\\nI was slightly nervous when I rang the bell at Marby Grange the following\\nafternoon. I wondered very much what Poirot expected to find out. He had\\nentrusted the job to me. Why? Was it because, as in the case of questioning\\nMajor Blunt, he wished to remain in the background? The wish, intelligible\\nin the first case, seemed to me quite meaningless here.\\nMy meditations were interrupted by the advent of a smart parlourmaid.\\nYes, Mrs. Folliott was at home. I was ushered into a big drawing room,\\nand looked round me curiously as I waited for the mistress of the house. A\\nlarge bare room, some good bits of old china, and some beautiful etchings,\\nshabby covers and curtains. A lady’s room in every sense of the term.\\nI turned from the inspection of a Bartolozzi on the wall as Mrs. Folliott\\ncame into the room. She was a tall woman, with untidy brown hair, and a\\nvery winning smile.\\n“Dr. Sheppard,” she said hesitatingly.\\n“That is my name,” I replied. “I must apologize for calling upon you\\nlike this, but I wanted some information about a parlourmaid previously\\nemployed by you, Ursula Bourne.”\\nWith the utterance of the name the smile vanished from her face, and all\\nthe cordiality froze out of her manner. She looked uncomfortable and ill at\\nease.\\n“Ursula Bourne?” she said hesitatingly.\\n“Yes,” I said. “Perhaps you don’t remember the name?”\\n“Oh, yes, of course. I—I remember perfectly.”\\n“She left you just over a year ago, I understand?”\\n“Yes. Yes, she did. That is quite right.”\\n“And you were satisfied with her whilst she was with you? How long\\nwas she with you, by the way?”\\n“Oh! a year or two—I can’t remember exactly how long. She—she is\\nvery capable. I’m sure you will find her quite satisfactory. I didn’t know she\\nwas leaving Fernly. I hadn’t the least idea of it.”\\n“Can you tell me anything about her?” I asked.\\n“Anything about her?”\\n“Yes, where she comes from, who her people are—that sort of thing?”\\nMrs. Folliott’s face wore more than ever its frozen look.\\n“I don’t know at all.”\\n“Who was she with before she came to you?”\\n“I’m afraid I don’t remember.”\\nThere was a spark of anger now underlying her nervousness. She flung\\nup her head in a gesture that was vaguely familiar.\\n“Is it really necessary to ask all these questions?”\\n“Not at all,” I said, with an air of surprise and a tinge of apology in my\\nmanner. “I had no idea you would mind answering them. I am very sorry.”\\nHer anger left her and she became confused again.\\n“Oh! I don’t mind answering them. I assure you I don’t. Why should I?\\nIt—it just seemed a little odd, you know. That’s all. A little odd.”\\nOne advantage of being a medical practitioner is that you can usually\\ntell when people are lying to you. I should have known from Mrs. Folliott’s\\nmanner, if from nothing else, that she did mind answering my questions—\\nminded intensely. She was thoroughly uncomfortable and upset, and there\\nwas plainly some mystery in the background. I judged her to be a woman\\nquite unused to deception of any kind, and consequently rendered acutely\\nuneasy when forced to practise it. A child could have seen through her.\\nBut it was also clear the she had no intention of telling me anything\\nfurther. Whatever the mystery centring round Ursula Bourne might be, I\\nwas not going to learn it through Mrs. Folliott.\\nDefeated, I apologized once more for disturbing her, took my hat and\\ndeparted.\\nI went to see a couple of patients and arrived home about six o’clock.\\nCaroline was sitting beside the wreck of tea things. She had that look of\\nsuppressed exultation on her face which I know only too well. It is a sure\\nsign with her of either the getting or the giving of information. I wondered\\nwhich it had been.\\n“I’ve had a very interesting afternoon,” began Caroline, as I dropped\\ninto my own particular easy chair and stretched out my feet to the inviting\\nblaze in the fireplace.\\n“Have you?” I said. “Miss Gannett drop in to tea?”\\nMiss Gannett is one of the chief of our newsmongers.\\n“Guess again,” said Caroline, with intense complacency.\\nI guessed several times, working slowly through all the members of\\nCaroline’s Intelligence Corps. My sister received each guess with a\\ntriumphant shake of the head. In the end she volunteered the information\\nherself.\\n“M. Poirot!” she said. “Now, what do you think of that?”\\nI thought a good many things of it, but I was careful not to say them to\\nCaroline.\\n“Why did he come?” I asked.\\n“To see me, of course. He said that, knowing my brother so well, he\\nhoped he might be permitted to make the acquaintance of his charming\\nsister—your charming sister, I’ve got mixed up—but you know what I\\nmean.”\\n“What did he talk about?” I asked.\\n“He told me a lot about himself and his cases. You know that Prince\\nPaul of Mauretania—the one who’s just married a dancer?”\\n“Yes?”\\n“I saw a most intriguing paragraph about her in Society Snippets the\\nother day, hinting that she was really a Russian Grand Duchess—one of the\\nCzar’s daughters who managed to escape from the Bolsheviks. Well, it\\nseems that M. Poirot solved a baffling murder mystery that threatened to\\ninvolve them both. Prince Paul was beside himself with gratitude.”\\n“Did he give him an emerald tie pin the size of a plover’s egg?” I\\ninquired sarcastically.\\n“He didn’t mention it. Why?”\\n“Nothing,” I said. “I thought it was always done. It is in detective\\nfiction anyway. The super-detective always has his rooms littered with\\nrubies and pearls and emeralds from grateful Royal clients.”\\n“It’s very interesting to hear about these things from the inside,” said\\nmy sister complacently.\\nIt would be—to Caroline. I could not but admire the ingenuity of M.\\nHercule Poirot, who had selected unerringly the case of all others that\\nwould most appeal to an elderly lady living in a small village.\\n“Did he tell you if the dancer was really a Grand Duchess?” I inquired.\\n“He was not at liberty to speak,” said Caroline importantly.\\nI wondered how far Poirot had strained the truth in talking to Caroline\\n—probably not at all. He had conveyed his innuendoes by means of his\\neyebrows and his shoulders.\\n“And after all this,” I remarked, “I suppose you were ready to eat out of\\nhis hand?”\\n“Don’t be coarse, James. I don’t know where you get these vulgar\\nexpressions from.”\\n“Probably from my only link with the outside world—my patients.\\nUnfortunately, my practice does not lie amongst Royal princes and\\ninteresting Russian émigrés.”\\nCaroline pushed her spectacles up and looked at me.\\n“You seem very grumpy, James. It must be your liver. A blue pill, I\\nthink, tonight.”\\nTo see me in my own home, you would never imagine that I was a\\ndoctor of medicine. Caroline does the home prescribing both for herself and\\nme.\\n“Damn my liver,” I said irritably. “Did you talk about the murder at\\nall?”\\n“Well, naturally, James. What else is there to talk about locally? I was\\nable to set M. Poirot straight upon several points. He was very grateful to\\nme. He said I had the makings of a born detective in me—and a wonderful\\npsychological insight into human nature.”\\nCaroline was exactly like a cat that is full to overflowing with rich\\ncream. She was positively purring.\\n“He talked a lot about the little grey cells of the brain, and of their\\nfunctions. His own, he says, are of the first quality.”\\n“He would say so,” I remarked bitterly. “Modesty is certainly not his\\nmiddle name.”\\n“I wish you wouldn’t be so horribly American, James. He thought it\\nvery important that Ralph should be found as soon as possible, and induced\\nto come forward and give an account of himself. He says that his\\ndisappearance will produce a very unfortunate impression at the inquest.”\\n“And what did you say to that?”\\n“I agreed with him,” said Caroline importantly. “And I was able to tell\\nhim the way people were talking already about it.”\\n“Caroline,” I said sharply, “did you tell M. Poirot what you overheard in\\nthe wood that day?”\\n“I did,” said Caroline complacently.\\nI got up and began to walk about.\\n“You realize what you’re doing, I hope,” I jerked out. “You’re putting a\\nhalter round Ralph Paton’s neck as surely as you’re sitting in that chair.”\\n“Not at all,” said Caroline, quite unruffled. “I was surprised you hadn’t\\ntold him.”\\n“I took very good care not to,” I said. “I’m fond of that boy.”\\n“So am I. That’s why I say you’re talking nonsense. I don’t believe\\nRalph did it, and so the truth can’t hurt him, and we ought to give M. Poirot\\nall the help we can. Why, think, very likely Ralph was out with that\\nidentical girl on the night of the murder, and if so, he’s got a perfect alibi.”\\n“If he’s got a perfect alibi,” I retorted, “why doesn’t he come forward\\nand say so?”\\n“Might get the girl into trouble,” said Caroline sapiently. “But if M.\\nPoirot gets hold of her, and puts it to her as her duty, she’ll come forward of\\nher own accord and clear Ralph.”\\n“You seem to have invented a romantic fairy story of your own,” I said.\\n“You read too many trashy novels, Caroline. I’ve always told you so.”\\nI dropped into my chair again.\\n“Did Poirot ask you any more questions?” I inquired.\\n“Only about the patients you had that morning.”\\n“The patients?” I demanded, unbelievingly.\\n“Yes, your surgery patients. How many and who they were.”\\n“Do you mean to say you were able to tell him that?” I demanded.\\nCaroline is really amazing.\\n“Why not?” asked my sister triumphantly. “I can see the path up to the\\nsurgery door perfectly from this window. And I’ve got an excellent\\nmemory, James. Much better than yours, let me tell you.”\\n“I’m sure you have,” I murmured mechanically.\\nMy sister went on, checking the names on her fingers.\\n“There was old Mrs. Bennett, and that boy from the farm with the bad\\nfinger, Dolly Grice to have a needle out of her finger; that American\\nsteward off the liner. Let me see—that’s four. Yes, and old George Evans\\nwith his ulcer. And lastly—”\\nShe paused significantly.\\n“Well?”\\nCaroline brought out her climax triumphantly. She hissed it in the most\\napproved style—aided by the fortunate number of s’s at her disposal.\\n“Miss Russell!”\\nShe sat back in her chair and looked at me meaningly, and when\\nCaroline looks at you meaningly, it is impossible to miss it.\\n“I don’t know what you mean,” I said, quite untruthfully. “Why\\nshouldn’t Miss Russell consult me about her bad knee?”\\n“Bad knee,” said Caroline. “Fiddlesticks! No more bad knee than you\\nand I. She was after something else.”\\n“What?” I asked.\\nCaroline had to admit that she didn’t know.\\n“But depend upon it, that was what he was trying to get at—M. Poirot, I\\nmean. There’s something fishy about that woman, and he knows it.”\\n“Precisely the remark Mrs. Ackroyd made to me yesterday,” I said.\\n“That there was something fishy about Miss Russell.”\\n“Ah!” said Caroline darkly, “Mrs. Ackroyd! There’s another!”\\n“Another what?”\\nCaroline refused to explain her remarks. She merely nodded her head\\nseveral times, rolling up her knitting, and went upstairs to don the high\\nmauve silk blouse and the gold locket which she calls dressing for dinner.\\nI stayed there staring into the fire and thinking over Caroline’s words.\\nHad Poirot really come to gain information about Miss Russell, or was it\\nonly Caroline’s tortuous mind that interpreted everything according to her\\nown ideas?\\nThere had certainly been nothing in Miss Russell’s manner that morning\\nto arouse suspicion. At least—\\nI remembered her persistent conversation on the subject of drug-taking\\n—and from that she had led the conversation to poisons and poisoning. But\\nthere was nothing in that. Ackroyd had not been poisoned. Still, it was\\nodd….\\nI heard Caroline’s voice, rather acid in tone, calling from the top of the\\nstairs.\\n“James, you will be late for dinner.”\\nI put some coal on the fire and went upstairs obediently.\\nIt is well at any price to have peace in the home.\\nTwelve\\nROUND THE TABLE\\nA joint inquest was held on Monday.\\nI do not propose to give the proceedings in detail. To do so would only\\nbe to go over the same ground again and again. By arrangement with the\\npolice, very little was allowed to come out. I gave evidence as to the cause\\nof Ackroyd’s death and the probable time. The absence of Ralph Paton was\\ncommented on by the coroner, but not unduly stressed.\\nAfterwards, Poirot and I had a few words with Inspector Raglan. The\\ninspector was very grave.\\n“It looks bad, M. Poirot,” he said. “I’m trying to judge the thing fair and\\nsquare. I’m a local man, and I’ve seen Captain Paton many times in\\nCranchester. I’m not wanting him to be the guilty one—but it’s bad\\nwhichever way you look at it. If he’s innocent, why doesn’t he come\\nforward? We’ve got evidence against him, but it’s just possible that the\\nevidence could be explained away. Then why doesn’t he give an\\nexplanation?”\\nA lot more lay behind the inspector’s words than I knew at the time.\\nRalph’s description had been wired to every port and railway station in\\nEngland. The police everywhere were on the alert. His rooms in town were\\nwatched, and any houses he had been known to be in the habit of\\nfrequenting. With such a cordon it seemed impossible that Ralph should be\\nable to evade detection. He had no luggage, and, as far as anyone knew, no\\nmoney.\\n“I can’t find anyone who saw him at the station that night,” continued\\nthe inspector. “And yet he’s well known down here, and you’d think\\nsomebody would have noticed him. There’s no news from Liverpool\\neither.”\\n“You think he went to Liverpool?” queried Poirot.\\n“Well, it’s on the cards. That telephone message from the station, just\\nthree minutes before the Liverpool express left—there ought to be\\nsomething in that.”\\n“Unless it was deliberately intended to throw you off the scent. That\\nmight just possibly be the point of the telephone message.”\\n“That’s an idea,” said the inspector eagerly. “Do you really think that’s\\nthe explanation of the telephone call?”\\n“My friend,” said Poirot gravely, “I do not know. But I will tell you this:\\nI believe that when we find the explanation of that telephone call we shall\\nfind the explanation of the murder.”\\n“You said something like that before, I remember,” I observed, looking\\nat him curiously.\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“I always come back to it,” he said seriously.\\n“It seems to me utterly irrelevant,” I declared.\\n“I wouldn’t say that,” demurred the inspector. “But I must confess I\\nthink Mr. Poirot here harps on it a little too much. We’ve better clues than\\nthat. The fingerprints on the dagger, for instance.”\\nPoirot became suddenly very foreign in manner, as he often did when\\nexcited over anything.\\n“M. l’Inspecteur,” he said, “beware of the blind—the blind—comment\\ndire?—the little street that has no end to it.”\\nInspector Raglan stared, but I was quicker.\\n“You mean a blind alley?” I said.\\n“That is it—the blind street that leads nowhere. So it may be with those\\nfingerprints—they may lead you nowhere.”\\n“I don’t see how that can well be,” said the police officer. “I suppose\\nyou’re hinting that they’re faked? I’ve read of such things being done,\\nthough I can’t say I’ve ever come across it in my experience. But fake or\\ntrue—they’re bound to lead somewhere.”\\nPoirot merely shrugged his shoulders, flinging out his arms wide.\\nThe inspector then showed us various enlarged photographs of the\\nfingerprints, and proceeded to become technical on the subject of loops and\\nwhorls.\\n“Come now,” he said at last, annoyed by Poirot’s detached manner,\\n“you’ve got to admit that those prints were made by someone who was in\\nthe house that night?”\\n“Bien entendu,” said Poirot, nodding his head.\\n“Well, I’ve taken the prints of every member of the household,\\neveryone, mind you, from the old lady down to the kitchen maid.”\\nI don’t think Mrs. Ackroyd would enjoy being referred to as the old\\nlady. She must spend a considerable amount on cosmetics.\\n“Everyone’s,” repeated the inspector fussily.\\n“Including mine,” I said drily.\\n“Very well. None of them correspond. That leaves us two alternatives.\\nRalph Paton, or the mysterious stranger the doctor here tells us about. When\\nwe get hold of those two—”\\n“Much valuable time may have been lost,” broke in Poirot.\\n“I don’t quite get you, Mr. Poirot.”\\n“You have taken the prints of everyone in the house, you say,”\\nmurmured Poirot. “Is that the exact truth you are telling me there, M.\\nl’Inspecteur?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“Without overlooking anyone?”\\n“Without overlooking anyone.”\\n“The quick or the dead?”\\nFor a moment the inspector looked bewildered at what he took to be a\\nreligious observation. Then he reacted slowly.\\n“You mean—?”\\n“The dead, M. l’Inspecteur.”\\nThe inspector still took a minute or two to understand.\\n“I am suggesting,” said Poirot placidly, “that the fingerprints on the\\ndagger handle are those of Mr. Ackroyd himself. It is an easy matter to\\nverify. His body is still available.”\\n“But why? What would be the point of it? You’re surely not suggesting\\nsuicide, Mr. Poirot?”\\n“Ah! no. My theory is that the murderer wore gloves or wrapped\\nsomething round his hand. After the blow was struck, he picked up the\\nvictim’s hand and closed it round the dagger handle.”\\n“But why?”\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders again.\\n“To make a confusing case even more confusing.”\\n“Well,” said the inspector. “I’ll look into it. What gave you the idea in\\nthe first place?”\\n“When you were so kind as to show me the dagger and draw attention\\nto the fingerprints. I know very little of loops and whorls—see, I confess\\nmy ignorance frankly. But it did occur to me that the position of the prints\\nwas somewhat awkward. Not so would I have held a dagger in order to\\nstrike. Naturally, with the right hand brought up over the shoulder\\nbackwards, it would have been difficult to put it in exactly the right\\nposition.”\\nInspector Raglan stared at the little man. Poirot, with an air of great\\nunconcern, flecked a speck of dust from his coat sleeve.\\n“Well,” said the inspector. “It’s an idea. I’ll look into it all right, but\\ndon’t you be disappointed if nothing comes of it.”\\nHe endeavoured to make his tone kindly and patronising. Poirot\\nwatched him go off. Then he turned to me with twinkling eyes.\\n“Another time,” he observed, “I must be more careful of his amour\\npropre. And now that we are left to our own devices, what do you think, my\\ngood friend, of a little reunion of the family?”\\nThe “little reunion,” as Poirot called it, took place about half an hour\\nlater. We sat round the table in the dining room at Fernly. Poirot at the head\\nof the table, like the chairman of some ghastly board meeting. The servants\\nwere not present, so we were six in all. Mrs. Ackroyd, Flora, Major Blunt,\\nyoung Raymond, Poirot and myself.\\nWhen everyone was assembled, Poirot rose and bowed.\\n“Messieurs, mesdames, I have called you together for a certain\\npurpose.” He paused. “To begin with, I want to make a very special plea to\\nmademoiselle.”\\n“To me?” said Flora.\\n“Mademoiselle, you are engaged to Captain Ralph Paton. If anyone is in\\nhis confidence, you are. I beg you, most earnestly, if you know of his\\nwhereabouts, to persuade him to come forward. One little minute”—as\\nFlora raised her head to speak—“say nothing till you have well reflected.\\nMademoiselle, his position grows daily more dangerous. If he had come\\nforward at once, no matter how damning the facts, he might have had a\\nchance of explaining them away. But this silence—this flight—what can it\\nmean? Surely only one thing, knowledge of guilt. Mademoiselle, if you\\nreally believe in his innocence, persuade him to come forward before it is\\ntoo late.”\\nFlora’s face had gone very white.\\n“Too late!” she repeated, very low.\\nPoirot leant forward, looking at her.\\n“See now, mademoiselle,” he said very gently, “it is Papa Poirot who\\nasks you this. The old Papa Poirot who has much knowledge and much\\nexperience. I would not seek to entrap you, mademoiselle. Will you not\\ntrust me—and tell me where Ralph Paton is hiding?”\\nThe girl rose and stood facing him.\\n“M. Poirot,” she said in a clear voice, “I swear to you—swear solemnly\\n—that I have no idea where Ralph is, and that I have neither seen him nor\\nheard from him either on the day of—of the murder, or since.”\\nShe sat down again. Poirot gazed at her in silence for a minute or two,\\nthen he brought his hand down on the table with a sharp rap.\\n“Bien! That is that,” he said. His face hardened. “Now I appeal to these\\nothers who sit round this table, Mrs. Ackroyd, Major Blunt, Dr. Sheppard,\\nMr. Raymond. You are all friends and intimates of the missing man. If you\\nknow where Ralph Paton is hiding, speak out.”\\nThere was a long silence. Poirot looked to each in turn.\\n“I beg of you,” he said in a low voice, “speak out.”\\nBut still there was silence, broken at last by Mrs. Ackroyd.\\n“I must say,” she observed in a plaintive voice, “that Ralph’s absence is\\nmost peculiar—most peculiar indeed. Not to come forward at such a time. It\\nlooks, you know, as though there were something behind it. I can’t help\\nthinking, Flora dear, that it was a very fortunate thing your engagement was\\nnever formally announced.”\\n“Mother!” cried Flora angrily.\\n“Providence,” declared Mrs. Ackroyd. “I have a devout belief in\\nProvidence—a divinity that shapes our ends, as Shakespeare’s beautiful line\\nruns.”\\n“Surely you don’t make the Almighty directly responsible for thick\\nankles, Mrs. Ackroyd, do you?” asked Geoffrey Raymond, his irresponsible\\nlaugh ringing out.\\nHis idea was, I think, to loosen the tension, but Mrs. Ackroyd threw him\\na glance of reproach and took out her handkerchief.\\n“Flora has been saved a terrible amount of notoriety and\\nunpleasantness. Not for a moment that I think dear Ralph had anything to\\ndo with poor Roger’s death. I don’t think so. But then I have a trusting heart\\n—I always have had, ever since a child. I am loath to believe the worst of\\nanyone. But, of course, one must remember that Ralph was in several air\\nraids as a young boy. The results are apparent long after, sometimes, they\\nsay. People are not responsible for their actions in the least. They lose\\ncontrol, you know, without being able to help it.”\\n“Mother,” cried Flora, “you don’t think Ralph did it?”\\n“Come, Mrs. Ackroyd,” said Blunt.\\n“I don’t know what to think,” said Mrs. Ackroyd tearfully. “It’s all very\\nupsetting. What would happen to the estate, I wonder, if Ralph were found\\nguilty?”\\nRaymond pushed his chair away from the table violently. Major Blunt\\nremained very quiet, looking thoughtfully at her.\\n“Like shell shock, you know,” said Mrs. Ackroyd obstinately, “and I\\ndare say Roger kept him very short of money—with the best intentions, of\\ncourse. I can see you are all against me, but I do think it is very odd that\\nRalph has not come forward, and I must say I am thankful Flora’s\\nengagement was never announced formally.”\\n“It will be tomorrow,” said Flora in a clear voice.\\n“Flora!” cried her mother, aghast.\\nFlora had turned to the secretary.\\n“Will you send the announcement to the Morning Post. And The Times,\\nplease, Mr. Raymond.”\\n“If you are sure that it is wise, Miss Ackroyd,” he replied gravely.\\nShe turned impulsively to Blunt.\\n“You understand,” she said. “What else can I do? As things are, I must\\nstand by Ralph. Don’t you see that I must?”\\nShe looked very searchingly at him, and after a long pause he nodded\\nabruptly.\\nMrs. Ackroyd burst out into shrill protests. Flora remained unmoved.\\nThen Raymond spoke.\\n“I appreciate your motives, Miss Ackroyd. But don’t you think you’re\\nbeing rather precipitate? Wait a day or two.”\\n“Tomorrow,” said Flora in a clear voice. “It’s no good, Mother, going on\\nlike this. Whatever else I am, I’m not disloyal to my friends.”\\n“M. Poirot,” Mrs. Ackroyd appealed tearfully. “Can’t you say anything\\nat all?”\\n“Nothing to be said,” interpolated Blunt. “She’s doing the right thing.\\nI’ll stand by her through thick and thin.”\\nFlora held out her hand to him.\\n“Thank you, Major Blunt,” she said.\\n“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot, “will you let an old man congratulate you\\non your courage and your loyalty? And will you not misunderstand me if I\\nask you—ask you most solemnly—to postpone the announcement you\\nspeak of for at least two days more?”\\nFlora hesitated.\\n“I ask it in Ralph Paton’s interests as much as in yours, mademoiselle.\\nYou frown. You do not see how that can be. But I assure you that it is so.\\nPas de blagues. You put the case into my hands—you must not hamper me\\nnow.”\\nFlora paused a few minutes before replying.\\n“I do not like it,” she said at last, “but I will do what you say.”\\nShe sat down again at the table.\\n“And now, messieurs et mesdames,” said Poirot rapidly, “I will continue\\nwith what I was about to say. Understand this, I mean to arrive at the truth.\\nThe truth, however ugly in itself, is always curious and beautiful to the\\nseeker after it. I am much aged, my powers may not be what they were.”\\nHere he clearly expected a contradiction. “In all probability this is the last\\ncase I shall ever investigate. But Hercule Poirot does not end with a failure.\\nMessieurs et mesdames, I tell you, I mean to know. And I shall know—in\\nspite of you all.”\\nHe brought out the last words provocatively, hurling them in our face as\\nit were. I think we all flinched back a little, excepting Geoffrey Raymond,\\nwho remained good-humoured and imperturbable as usual.\\n“How do you mean—in spite of us all?” he asked, with slightly raised\\neyebrows.\\n“But—just that, monsieur. Every one of you in this room is concealing\\nsomething from me.” He raised his hand as a faint murmur of protest arose.\\n“Yes, yes, I know what I am saying. It may be something unimportant—\\ntrivial—which is supposed to have no bearing on the case, but there it is.\\nEach one of you has something to hide. Come now, am I right?”\\nHis glance, challenging and accusing, swept round the table. And every\\npair of eyes dropped before his. Yes, mine as well.\\n“I am answered,” said Poirot, with a curious laugh. He got up from his\\nseat. “I appeal to you all. Tell me the truth—the whole truth.” There was a\\nsilence. “Will no one speak?”\\nHe gave the same short laugh again.\\n“C’est dommage,” he said, and went out.\\nThirteen\\nTHE GOOSE QUILL\\nThat evening, at Poirot’s request, I went over to his house after dinner.\\nCaroline saw me depart with visible reluctance. I think she would have\\nliked to have accompanied me.\\nPoirot greeted me hospitably. He had placed a bottle of Irish whiskey\\n(which I detest) on a small table, with a soda water siphon and a glass. He\\nhimself was engaged in brewing hot chocolate. It was a favourite beverage\\nof his, I discovered later.\\nHe inquired politely after my sister, whom he declared to be a most\\ninteresting woman.\\n“I’m afraid you’ve been giving her a swelled head,” I said drily. “What\\nabout Sunday afternoon?”\\nHe laughed and twinkled.\\n“I always like to employ the expert,” he remarked obscurely, but he\\nrefused to explain the remark.\\n“You got all the local gossip anyway,” I remarked. “True, and untrue.”\\n“And a great deal of valuable information,” he added quietly.\\n“Such as—”\\nHe shook his head.\\n“Why not have told me the truth?” he countered. “In a place like this, all\\nRalph Paton’s doings were bound to be known. If your sister had not\\nhappened to pass through the wood that day somebody else would have\\ndone so.”\\n“I suppose they would,” I said grumpily. “What about this interest of\\nyours in my patients?”\\nAgain he twinkled.\\n“Only one of them, doctor. Only one of them.”\\n“The last?” I hazarded.\\n“I find Miss Russell a study of the most interesting,” he said evasively.\\n“Do you agree with my sister and Mrs. Ackroyd that there is something\\nfishy about her?” I asked.\\n“Eh? What do you say—fishy?”\\nI explained to the best of my ability.\\n“And they say that, do they?”\\n“Didn’t my sister convey as much to you yesterday afternoon?”\\n“C’est possible.”\\n“For no reason whatever,” I declared.\\n“Les femmes,” generalized Poirot. “They are marvellous! They invent\\nhaphazard—and by miracle they are right. Not that it is that, really. Women\\nobserve subconsciously a thousand little details, without knowing that they\\nare doing so. Their subconscious mind adds these little things together—\\nand they call the result intuition. Me, I am very skilled in psychology. I\\nknow these things.”\\nHe swelled his chest out importantly, looking so ridiculous that I found\\nit difficult not to burst out laughing. Then he took a small sip of his\\nchocolate, and carefully wiped his moustache.\\n“I wish you’d tell me,” I burst out, “what you really think of it all?”\\nHe put down his cup.\\n“You wish that?”\\n“I do.”\\n“You have seen what I have seen. Should not our ideas be the same?”\\n“I’m afraid you’re laughing at me,” I said stiffly. “Of course, I’ve no\\nexperience of matters of this kind.”\\nPoirot smiled at me indulgently.\\n“You are like the little child who wants to know the way the engine\\nworks. You wish to see the affair, not as the family doctor sees it, but with\\nthe eye of a detective who knows and cares for no one—to whom they are\\nall strangers and all equally liable to suspicion.”\\n“You put it very well,” I said.\\n“So I give you, then, a little lecture. The first thing is to get a clear\\nhistory of what happened that evening—always bearing in mind that the\\nperson who speaks may be lying.”\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n“Rather a suspicious attitude.”\\n“But necessary—I assure you, necessary. Now first—Dr. Sheppard\\nleaves the house at ten minutes to nine. How do I know that?”\\n“Because I told you so.”\\n“But you might not be speaking the truth—or the watch you went by\\nmight be wrong. But Parker also says that you left the house at ten minutes\\nto nine. So we accept that statement and pass on. At nine o’clock you run\\ninto a man—and here we come to what we will call the Romance of the\\nMysterious Stranger—just outside the Park gates. How do I know that that\\nis so?”\\n“I told you so,” I began again, but Poirot interrupted me with a gesture\\nof impatience.\\n“Ah! but it is that you are a little stupid tonight, my friend. You know\\nthat it is so—but how am I to know? Eh bien, I am able to tell you that the\\nMysterious Stranger was not a hallucination on your part, because the maid\\nof a Miss Gannett met him a few minutes before you did, and of her too he\\ninquired the way to Fernly Park. We accept his presence, therefore, and we\\ncan be fairly sure of two things about him—that he was a stranger to the\\nneighbourhood, and that whatever his object in going to Fernly, there was\\nno great secrecy about it, since he twice asked the way there.”\\n“Yes,” I said, “I see that.”\\n“Now I have made it my business to find out more about this man. He\\nhad a drink at the Three Boars, I learn, and the barmaid there says that he\\nspoke with an American accent and mentioned having just come over from\\nthe States. Did it strike you that he had an American accent?”\\n“Yes, I think he had,” I said, after a minute or two, during which I cast\\nmy mind back; “but a very slight one.”\\n“Précisément. There is also this, which, you will remember, I picked up\\nin the summerhouse.”\\nHe held out to me the little quill. I looked at it curiously. Then a\\nmemory of something I had read stirred in me.\\nPoirot, who had been watching my face, nodded.\\n“Yes, heroin, ‘snow’. Drug-takers carry it like this, and sniff it up the\\nnose.”\\n“Diamorphine hydrochloride,” I murmured mechanically.\\n“This method of taking the drug is very common on the other side.\\nAnother proof, if we wanted one, that the man came from Canada or the\\nStates.”\\n“What first attracted your attention to that summerhouse?” I asked\\ncuriously.\\n“My friend the inspector took it for granted that anyone using that path\\ndid so as a short cut to the house, but as soon as I saw the summerhouse, I\\nrealized that the same path would be taken by anyone using the\\nsummerhouse as a rendezvous. Now it seems fairly certain that the stranger\\ncame neither to the front nor to the back door. Then did someone from the\\nhouse go out and meet him? If so, what could be a more convenient place\\nthan that little summerhouse? I searched it with the hope that I might find\\nsome clue inside. I found two, the scrap of cambric and the quill.”\\n“And the scrap of cambric?” I asked curiously. “What about that?”\\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.\\n“You do not use your little grey cells,” he remarked drily. “The scrap of\\nstarched cambric should be obvious.”\\n“Not very obvious to me.” I changed the subject. “Anyway,” I said,\\n“this man went to the summerhouse to meet somebody. Who was that\\nsomebody?”\\n“Exactly the question,” said Poirot. “You will remember that Mrs.\\nAckroyd and her daughter came over from Canada to live here?”\\n“Is that what you meant today when you accused them of hiding the\\ntruth?”\\n“Perhaps. Now another point. What did you think of the parlourmaid’s\\nstory?”\\n“What story?”\\n“The story of her dismissal. Does it take half an hour to dismiss a\\nservant? Was the story of those important papers a likely one? And\\nremember, though she says she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until\\nten o’clock, there is no one to confirm her statement.”\\n“You bewilder me,” I said.\\n“To me it grows clearer. But tell me now your own ideas and theories.”\\nI drew a piece of paper from my pocket.\\n“I just scribbled down a few suggestions,” I said apologetically.\\n“But excellent—you have method. Let us hear them.”\\nI read out in a somewhat embarrassed voice.\\n“To begin with, one must look at the thing logically—”\\n“Just what my poor Hastings used to say,” interrupted Poirot, “but alas!\\nhe never did so.”\\n“Point No. 1.—Mr. Ackroyd was heard talking to someone at half past\\nnine.\\n“Point No. 2.—At some time during the evening Ralph Paton must have\\ncome in through the window, as evidenced by the prints of his shoes.\\n“Point No. 3.—Mr. Ackroyd was nervous that evening, and would only\\nhave admitted someone he knew.\\n“Point No. 4.—The person with Mr. Ackroyd at nine-thirty was asking\\nfor money. We know Ralph Paton was in a scrape.\\n“These four points go to show that the person with Mr. Ackroyd at ninethirty was Ralph Paton. But we know that Mr. Ackroyd was alive at a\\nquarter to ten, therefore it was not Ralph who killed him. Ralph left the\\nwindow open. Afterwards the murderer came in that way.”\\n“And who was the murderer?” inquired Poirot.\\n“The American stranger. He may have been in league with Parker, and\\npossibly in Parker we have the man who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. If so,\\nParker may have heard enough to realize the game was up, have told his\\naccomplice so, and the latter did the crime with the dagger which Parker\\ngave him.”\\n“It is a theory that,” admitted Poirot. “Decidedly you have cells of a\\nkind. But it leaves a good deal unaccounted for.”\\n“Such as—”\\n“The telephone call, the pushed-out chair—”\\n“Do you really think that latter important?” I interrupted.\\n“Perhaps not,” admitted my friend. “It may have been pulled out by\\naccident, and Raymond or Blunt may have shoved it into place\\nunconsciously under the stress of emotion. Then there is the missing forty\\npounds.”\\n“Given by Ackroyd to Ralph,” I suggested. “He may have reconsidered\\nhis first refusal.”\\n“That still leaves one thing unexplained.”\\n“What?”\\n“Why was Blunt so certain in his own mind that it was Raymond with\\nMr. Ackroyd at nine-thirty?”\\n“He explained that,” I said.\\n“You think so? I will not press the point. Tell me, instead, what were\\nRalph Paton’s reasons for disappearing?”\\n“That’s rather more difficult,” I said slowly. “I shall have to speak as a\\nmedical man. Ralph’s nerves must have gone phut! If he suddenly found out\\nthat his uncle had been murdered within a few minutes of his leaving him—\\nafter, perhaps, a rather stormy interview—well, he might get the wind up\\nand clear right out. Men have been known to do that—act guiltily when\\nthey’re perfectly innocent.”\\n“Yes, that is true,” said Poirot. “But we must not lose sight of one\\nthing.”\\n“I know what you’re going to say,” I remarked: “motive. Ralph Paton\\ninherits a great fortune by his uncle’s death.”\\n“That is one motive,” agreed Poirot.\\n“One?”\\n“Mais oui. Do you realize that there are three separate motives staring\\nus in the face. Somebody certainly stole the blue envelope and its contents.\\nThat is one motive. Blackmail! Ralph Paton may have been the man who\\nblackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. Remember, as far as Hammond knew, Ralph\\nPaton had not applied to his uncle for help of late. That looks as though he\\nwere being supplied with money elsewhere. Then there is the fact that he\\nwas in some—how do you say—scrape?—which he feared might get to his\\nuncle’s ears. And finally there is the one you have just mentioned.”\\n“Dear me,” I said, rather taken aback. “The case does seem black\\nagainst him.”\\n“Does it?” said Poirot. “That is where we disagree, you and I. Three\\nmotives—it is almost too much. I am inclined to believe that, after all,\\nRalph Paton is innocent.”\\nFourteen\\nMRS. ACKROYD\\nAfter the evening talk I have just chronicled, the affair seemed to me to\\nenter on a different phase. The whole thing can be divided into two parts,\\neach clear and distinct from the other. Part I ranges from Ackroyd’s death\\non the Friday evening to the following Monday night. It is the\\nstraightforward narrative of what occurred, as presented to Hercule Poirot. I\\nwas at Poirot’s elbow the whole time. I saw what he saw. I tried my best to\\nread his mind. As I know now, I failed in this latter task. Though Poirot\\nshowed me all his discoveries—as, for instance, the gold wedding-ring—he\\nheld back the vital and yet logical impressions that he formed. As I came to\\nknow later, this secrecy was characteristic of him. He would throw out hints\\nand suggestions, but beyond that he would not go.\\nAs I say, up till the Monday evening, my narrative might have been that\\nof Poirot himself. I played Watson to his Sherlock. But after Monday our\\nways diverged. Poirot was busy on his own account. I got to hear of what he\\nwas doing, because in King’s Abbot you get to hear of everything, but he\\ndid not take me into his confidence beforehand. And I, too, had my own\\npreoccupations.\\nOn looking back, the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal\\ncharacter of this period. Everyone had a hand in the elucidation of the\\nmystery. It was rather like a jig-saw puzzle to which everyone contributed\\ntheir own little piece of knowledge or discovery. But their task ended there.\\nTo Poirot alone belongs the renown of fitting those pieces into their correct\\nplace.\\nSome of the incidents seemed at the time irrelevant and unmeaning.\\nThere was, for instance, the question of the black boots. But that comes\\nlater…. To take things strictly in chronological order, I must begin with the\\nsummons from Mrs. Ackroyd.\\nShe sent for me early on Tuesday morning, and since the summons\\nsounded an urgent one, I hastened there, expecting to find her in extremis.\\nThe lady was in bed. So much did she concede to the etiquette of the\\nsituation. She gave me her bony hand, and indicated a chair drawn up to the\\nbedside.\\n“Well, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “and what’s the matter with you?”\\nI spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected\\nof general practitioners.\\n“I’m prostrated,” said Mrs. Ackroyd in a faint voice. “Absolutely\\nprostrated. It’s the shock of poor Roger’s death. They say these things often\\naren’t felt at the time, you know. It’s the reaction afterwards.”\\nIt is a pity that a doctor is precluded by his profession from being able\\nsometimes to say what he really thinks.\\nI would have given anything to be able to answer “Bunkum!”\\nInstead, I suggested a tonic. Mrs. Ackroyd accepted the tonic. One\\nmove in the game seemed now to be concluded. Not for a moment did I\\nimagine that I had been sent for because of the shock occasioned by\\nAckroyd’s death. But Mrs. Ackroyd is totally incapable of pursuing a\\nstraightforward course on any subject. She always approaches her object by\\ntortuous means. I wondered very much why it was she had sent for me.\\n“And then that scene—yesterday,” continued my patient.\\nShe paused as though expecting me to take up a cue.\\n“What scene?”\\n“Doctor, how can you? Have you forgotten? That dreadful little\\nFrenchman—or Belgian—or whatever he is. Bullying us all like he did. It\\nhas quite upset me. Coming on the top of Roger’s death.”\\n“I’m very sorry, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said.\\n“I don’t know what he meant—shouting at us like he did. I should hope\\nI know my duty too well to dream of concealing anything. I have given the\\npolice every assistance in my power.”\\nMrs. Ackroyd paused, and I said, “Quite so.” I was beginning to have a\\nglimmering of what all the trouble was about.\\n“No one can say that I have failed in my duty,” continued Mrs.\\nAckroyd. “I am sure Inspector Raglan is perfectly satisfied. Why should\\nthis little upstart of a foreigner make a fuss? A most ridiculous-looking\\ncreature he is too—just like a comic Frenchman in a revue. I can’t think\\nwhy Flora insisted on bringing him into the case. She never said a word to\\nme about it. Just went off and did it on her own. Flora is too independent. I\\nam a woman of the world and her mother. She should have come to me for\\nadvice first.”\\nI listened to all this in silence.\\n“What does he think? That’s what I want to know. Does he actually\\nimagine I’m hiding something? He—he—positively accused me\\nyesterday.”\\nI shrugged my shoulders.\\n“It is surely of no consequence, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said. “Since you are\\nnot concealing anything, any remarks he may have made do not apply to\\nyou.”\\nMrs. Ackroyd went off at a tangent, after her usual fashion.\\n“Servants are so tiresome,” she said. “They gossip, and talk amongst\\nthemselves. And then it gets round—and all the time there’s probably\\nnothing in it at all.”\\n“Have the servants been talking?” I asked. “What about?”\\nMrs. Ackroyd cast a very shrewd glance at me. It quite threw me off my\\nbalance.\\n“I was sure you’d know, doctor, if anyone did. You were with M. Poirot\\nall the time, weren’t you?”\\n“I was.”\\n“Then of course you know. It was that girl, Ursula Bourne, wasn’t it?\\nNaturally—she’s leaving. She would want to make all the trouble she could.\\nSpiteful, that’s what they are. They’re all alike. Now, you being there,\\ndoctor, you must know exactly what she did say? I’m most anxious that no\\nwrong impression should get about. After all, you don’t repeat every little\\ndetail to the police, do you? There are family matters sometimes—nothing\\nto do with the question of the murder. But if the girl was spiteful, she may\\nhave made out all sorts of things.”\\nI was shrewd enough to see that a very real anxiety lay behind these\\noutpourings. Poirot had been justified in his premises. Of the six people\\nround the table yesterday, Mrs. Ackroyd at least had had something to hide.\\nIt was for me to discover what that something might be.\\n“If I were you, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said brusquely, “I should make a clean\\nbreast of things.”\\nShe gave a little scream.\\n“Oh! doctor, how can you be so abrupt. It sounds as though—as though\\n—And I can explain everything so simply.”\\n“Then why not do so?” I suggested.\\nMrs. Ackroyd took out a frilled handkerchief, and became tearful.\\n“I thought, doctor, that you might put it to M. Poirot—explain it, you\\nknow—because it’s so difficult for a foreigner to see our point of view. And\\nyou don’t know—nobody could know—what I’ve had to contend with. A\\nmartyrdom—a long martyrdom. That’s what my life has been. I don’t like\\nto speak ill of the dead—but there it is. Not the smallest bill but it had all to\\nbe gone over—just as though Roger had had a few miserly hundreds a year\\ninstead of being (as Mr. Hammond told me yesterday) one of the wealthiest\\nmen in these parts.”\\nMrs. Ackroyd paused to dab her eyes with the frilled handkerchief.\\n“Yes,” I said encouragingly. “You were talking about bills?”\\n“Those dreadful bills. And some I didn’t like to show Roger at all. They\\nwere things a man wouldn’t understand. He would have said the things\\nweren’t necessary. And of course they mounted up, you know, and they\\nkept coming in—”\\nShe looked at me appealingly, as though asking me to condole with her\\non this striking peculiarity.\\n“It’s a habit they have,” I agreed.\\nAnd the tone altered—became quite abusive. “I assure you, doctor, I\\nwas becoming a nervous wreck. I couldn’t sleep at nights. And a dreadful\\nfluttering round the heart. And then I got a letter from a Scotch gentleman\\n—as a matter of fact there were two letters—both Scotch gentlemen. Mr.\\nBruce MacPherson was one, and the other was Colin MacDonald. Quite a\\ncoincidence.”\\n“Hardly that,” I said drily. “They are usually Scotch gentlemen, but I\\nsuspect a Semitic strain in their ancestry.”\\n“Ten pounds to ten thousand on note of hand alone,” murmured Mrs.\\nAckroyd reminiscently. “I wrote to one of them, but it seemed there were\\ndifficulties.”\\nShe paused.\\nI gathered that we were just coming to delicate ground. I have never\\nknown anyone more difficult to bring to the point.\\n“You see,” murmured Mrs. Ackroyd, “it’s all a question of expectations,\\nisn’t it? Testamentary expectations. And though, of course, I expected that\\nRoger would provide for me, I didn’t know. I thought that if only I could\\nglance over a copy of his will—not in any sense of vulgar prying—but just\\nso that I could make my own arrangements.”\\nShe glanced sideways at me. The position was now very delicate\\nindeed. Fortunately words, ingeniously used, will serve to mask the ugliness\\nof naked facts.\\n“I could only tell this to you, dear Doctor Sheppard,” said Mrs. Ackroyd\\nrapidly. “I can trust you not to misjudge me, and to represent the matter in\\nthe right light to M. Poirot. It was on Friday afternoon—”\\nShe came to a stop and swallowed uncertainly.\\n“Yes,” I repeated encouragingly. “On Friday afternoon. Well?”\\n“Everyone was out, or so I thought. And I went into Roger’s study—I\\nhad some real reason for going there—I mean, there was nothing underhand\\nabout it. And as I saw all the papers heaped on the desk, it just came to me,\\nlike a flash: ‘I wonder if Roger keeps his will in one of the drawers of the\\ndesk.’ I’m so impulsive, always was, from a child. I do things on the spur of\\nthe moment. He’d left his keys—very careless of him—in the lock of the\\ntop drawer.”\\n“I see,” I said helpfully. “So you searched the desk. Did you find the\\nwill?”\\nMrs. Ackroyd gave a little scream, and I realized that I had not been\\nsufficiently diplomatic.\\n“How dreadful it sounds. But it wasn’t at all like that really.”\\n“Of course it wasn’t,” I said hastily. “You must forgive my unfortunate\\nway of putting things.”\\n“Of course, men are so peculiar. In dear Roger’s place, I should have\\nnot objected to revealing the provisions of my will. But men are so\\nsecretive. One is forced to adopt little subterfuges in self-defence.”\\n“And the result of the little subterfuge?” I asked.\\n“That’s just what I’m telling you. As I got to the bottom drawer, Bourne\\ncame in. Most awkward. Of course I shut the drawer and stood up, and I\\ncalled her attention to a few specks of dust on the surface. But I didn’t like\\nthe way she looked—quite respectful in manner, but a very nasty light in\\nher eyes. Almost contemptuous, if you know what I mean. I never have\\nliked that girl very much. She’s a good servant, and she says Ma’am, and\\ndoesn’t object to wearing caps and aprons (which I declare to you a lot of\\nthem do nowadays), and she can say ‘Not at home’ without scruples if she\\nhas to answer the door instead of Parker, and she doesn’t have those\\npeculiar gurgling noises inside which so many parlourmaids seem to have\\nwhen they wait at table—Let me see, where was I?”\\n“You were saying, that in spite of several valuable qualities, you never\\nliked Bourne.”\\n“No more I do. She’s—odd. There’s something different about her from\\nthe others. Too well educated, that’s my opinion. You can’t tell who are\\nladies and who aren’t nowadays.”\\n“And what happened next?” I asked.\\n“Nothing. At last, Roger came in. And I thought he was out for a walk.\\nAnd he said: ‘What’s all this?’ and I said, ‘Nothing. I just came in to fetch\\nPunch.’ And I took Punch and went out with it. Bourne stayed behind. I\\nheard her asking Roger if she could speak to him for a minute. I went\\nstraight up to my room, to lie down. I was very upset.”\\nThere was a pause.\\n“You will explain to M. Poirot, won’t you? You can see for yourself\\nwhat a trivial matter the whole thing was. But, of course, when he was so\\nstern about concealing things, I thought of this at once. Bourne may have\\nmade some extraordinary story out of it, but you can explain, can’t you?”\\n“That is all?” I said. “You have told me everything?”\\n“Ye-es,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “Oh! yes,” she added firmly.\\nBut I had noted the momentary hesitation, and I knew that there was\\nstill something she was keeping back. It was nothing less than a flash of\\nsheer genius that prompted me to ask the question I did.\\n“Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “was it you who left the silver table open?”\\nI had my answer in the blush of guilt that even rouge and powder could\\nnot conceal.\\n“How did you know?” she whispered.\\n“It was you, then?”\\n“Yes—I—you see—there were one or two pieces of old silver—very\\ninteresting. I had been reading up the subject and there was an illustration\\nof quite a small piece which had fetched an immense sum at Christy’s. It\\nlooked to be just the same as the one in the silver table. I thought I would\\ntake it up to London with me when I went—and—and have it valued. Then\\nif it really was a valuable piece, just think what a charming surprise it\\nwould have been for Roger.”\\nI refrained from comments, accepting Mrs. Ackroyd’s story on its\\nmerits. I even forbore to ask her why it was necessary to abstract what she\\nwanted in such a surreptitious manner.\\n“Why did you leave the lid open?” I asked. “Did you forget?”\\n“I was startled,” said Mrs. Ackroyd. “I heard footsteps coming along the\\nterrace outside. I hastened out of the room and just got up the stairs before\\nParker opened the front door to you.”\\n“That must have been Miss Russell,” I said thoughtfully. Mrs. Ackroyd\\nhad revealed to me one fact that was extremely interesting. Whether her\\ndesigns upon Ackroyd’s silver had been strictly honourable I neither knew\\nnor cared. What did interest me was the fact that Miss Russell must have\\nentered the drawing room by the window, and that I had not been wrong\\nwhen I judged her to be out of breath with running. Where had she been? I\\nthought of the summerhouse and the scrap of cambric.\\n“I wonder if Miss Russell has had her handkerchiefs starched!” I\\nexclaimed on the spur of the moment.\\nMrs. Ackroyd’s start recalled me to myself, and I rose.\\n“You think you can explain to M. Poirot?” she asked anxiously.\\n“Oh, certainly. Absolutely.”\\nI got away at last, after being forced to listen to more justifications of\\nher conduct.\\nThe parlourmaid was in the hall, and it was she who helped me on with\\nmy overcoat. I observed her more closely than I had done heretofore. It was\\nclear that she had been crying.\\n“How is it,” I asked, “that you told us that Mr. Ackroyd sent for you on\\nFriday to his study? I hear now that it was you who asked to speak to him.”\\nFor a minute the girl’s eyes dropped before mine.\\nThen she spoke.\\n“I meant to leave in any case,” she said uncertainly.\\nI said no more. She opened the front door for me. Just as I was passing\\nout, she said suddenly in a low voice:\\n“Excuse me, sir, is there any news of Captain Paton?”\\nI shook my head, looking at her inquiringly.\\n“He ought to come back,” she said. “Indeed—indeed he ought to come\\nback.”\\nShe was looking at me with appealing eyes.\\n“Does no one know where he is?” she asked.\\n“Do you?” I said sharply.\\nShe shook her head.\\n“No, indeed. I know nothing. But anyone who was a friend to him\\nwould tell him this: he ought to come back.”\\nI lingered, thinking that perhaps the girl would say more. Her next\\nquestion surprised me.\\n“When do they think the murder was done? Just before ten o’clock?”\\n“That is the idea,” I said. “Between a quarter to ten and the hour.”\\n“Not earlier? Not before a quarter to ten?”\\nI looked at her attentively. She was so clearly eager for a reply in the\\naffirmative.\\n“That’s out of the question,” I said. “Miss Ackroyd saw her uncle alive\\nat a quarter to ten.”\\nShe turned away, and her whole figure seemed to droop.\\n“A handsome girl,” I said to myself as I drove off. “An exceedingly\\nhandsome girl.”\\nCaroline was at home. She had had a visit from Poirot and was very\\npleased and important about it.\\n“I am helping him with the case,” she explained.\\nI felt rather uneasy. Caroline is bad enough as it is. What will she be\\nlike with her detective instincts encouraged?\\n“Are you going round the neighbourhood looking for Ralph Paton’s\\nmysterious girl?” I inquired.\\n“I might do that on my own account,” said Caroline. “No, this is a\\nspecial thing M. Poirot wants me to find out for him.”\\n“What is it?” I asked.\\n“He wants to know whether Ralph Paton’s boots were black or brown,”\\nsaid Caroline with tremendous solemnity.\\nI stared at her. I see now that I was unbelievably stupid about these\\nboots. I failed altogether to grasp the point.\\n“They were brown shoes,” I said. “I saw them.”\\n“Not shoes, James, boots. M. Poirot wants to know whether a pair of\\nboots Ralph had with him at the hotel were brown or black. A lot hangs on\\nit.”\\nCall me dense if you like. I didn’t see.\\n“And how are you going to find out?” I asked.\\nCaroline said there would be no difficulty about that. Our Annie’s\\ndearest friend was Miss Gannett’s maid, Clara. And Clara was walking out\\nwith the Boots at the Three Boars. The whole thing was simplicity itself,\\nand by the aid of Miss Gannett, who cooperated loyally, at once giving\\nClara leave of absence, the matter was rushed through at express speed.\\nIt was when we were sitting down to lunch that Caroline remarked, with\\nwould-be unconcern:\\n“About those boots of Ralph Paton’s.”\\n“Well,” I said, “what about them?”\\n“M. Poirot thought they were probably brown. He was wrong. They’re\\nblack.”\\nAnd Caroline nodded her head several times. She evidently felt that she\\nhad scored a point over Poirot.\\nI did not answer. I was puzzling over what the colour of a pair of Ralph\\nPaton’s boots had to do with the case.\\nFifteen\\nGEOFFREY RAYMOND\\nI was to have a further proof that day of the success of Poirot’s tactics. That\\nchallenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his knowledge of human\\nnature. A mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the truth from Mrs. Ackroyd.\\nShe was the first to react.\\nThat afternoon when I returned from seeing my patients, Caroline told\\nme that Geoffrey Raymond had just left.\\n“Did he want to see me?” I asked, as I hung up my coat in the hall.\\nCaroline was hovering by my elbow.\\n“It was M. Poirot he wanted to see,” she said. “He’d just come from\\nThe Larches. M. Poirot was out. Mr. Raymond thought that he might be\\nhere, or that you might know where he was.”\\n“I haven’t the least idea.”\\n“I tried to make him wait,” said Caroline, “but he said he would call\\nback at The Larches in half an hour, and went away down the village. A\\ngreat pity, because M. Poirot came in practically the minute after he left.”\\n“Came in here?”\\n“No, to his own house.”\\n“How do you know?”\\n“The side window,” said Caroline briefly.\\nIt seemed to me that we had now exhausted the topic. Caroline thought\\notherwise.\\n“Aren’t you going across?”\\n“Across where?”\\n“To The Larches, of course.”\\n“My dear Caroline,” I said, “what for?”\\n“Mr. Raymond wanted to see him very particularly,” said Caroline.\\n“You might hear what it’s all about.”\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n“Curiosity is not my besetting sin,” I remarked coldly. “I can exist\\ncomfortably without knowing exactly what my neighbours are doing and\\nthinking.”\\n“Stuff and nonsense, James,” said my sister. “You want to know just as\\nmuch as I do. You’re not so honest, that’s all. You always have to pretend.”\\n“Really, Caroline,” I said, and retired into my surgery.\\nTen minutes later Caroline tapped at the door and entered. In her hand\\nshe held what seemed to be a pot of jam.\\n“I wonder, James,” she said, “if you would mind taking this pot of\\nmedlar jelly across to M. Poirot? I promised it to him. He has never tasted\\nany home-made medlar jelly.”\\n“Why can’t Annie go?” I asked coldly.\\n“She’s doing some mending. I can’t spare her.”\\nCaroline and I looked at each other.\\n“Very well,” I said, rising. “But if I take the beastly thing, I shall just\\nleave it at the door. You understand that?”\\nMy sister raised her eyebrows.\\n“Naturally,” she said. “Who suggested you should do anything else?”\\nThe honours were with Caroline.\\n“If you do happen to see M. Poirot,” she said, as I opened the front\\ndoor, “you might tell him about the boots.”\\nIt was a most subtle parting shot. I wanted dreadfully to understand the\\nenigma of the boots. When the old lady with the Breton cap opened the\\ndoor to me, I found myself asking if M. Poirot was in, quite automatically.\\nPoirot sprang up to meet me, with every appearance of pleasure.\\n“Sit down, my good friend,” he said. “The big chair? This small one?\\nThe room is not too hot, no?”\\nI thought it was stifling, but refrained from saying so. The windows\\nwere closed, and a large fire burned in the grate.\\n“The English people, they have a mania for the fresh air,” declared\\nPoirot. “The big air, it is all very well outside, where it belongs. Why admit\\nit to the house? But let us not discuss such banalities. You have something\\nfor me, yes?”\\n“Two things,” I said. “First—this—from my sister.”\\nI handed over the pot of medlar jelly.\\n“How kind of Mademoiselle Caroline. She has remembered her\\npromise. And the second thing?”\\n“Information—of a kind.”\\nAnd I told him of my interview with Mrs. Ackroyd. He listened with\\ninterest, but not much excitement.\\n“It clears the ground,” he said thoughtfully. “And it has a certain value\\nas confirming the evidence of the housekeeper. She said, you remember,\\nthat she found the silver table lid open and closed it down in passing.”\\n“What about her statement that she went into the drawing room to see if\\nthe flowers were fresh?”\\n“Ah! we never took that very seriously, did we, my friend? It was\\npatently an excuse, trumped up in a hurry, by a woman who felt it urgent to\\nexplain her presence—which, by the way, you would probably never have\\nthought of questioning. I considered it possible that her agitation might\\narise from the fact that she had been tampering with the silver table, but I\\nthink now that we must look for another cause.”\\n“Yes,” I said. “Whom did she go out to meet? And why?”\\n“You think she went to meet someone?”\\n“I do.”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“So do I,” he said thoughtfully.\\nThere was a pause.\\n“By the way,” I said, “I’ve got a message for you from my sister. Ralph\\nPaton’s boots were black, not brown.”\\nI was watching him closely as I gave the message, and I fancied that I\\nsaw a momentary flicker of discomposure. If so, it passed almost\\nimmediately.\\n“She is absolutely positive they are not brown?”\\n“Absolutely.”\\n“Ah!” said Poirot regretfully. “That is a pity.”\\nAnd he seemed quite crestfallen.\\nHe entered into no explanations, but at once started a new subject of\\nconversation.\\n“The housekeeper, Miss Russell, who came to consult you on that\\nFriday morning—is it indiscreet to ask what passed at the interview—apart\\nfrom the medical details, I mean?”\\n“Not at all,” I said. “When the professional part of the conversation was\\nover, we talked for a few minutes about poisons, and the ease or difficulty\\nof detecting them, and about drug-taking and drug-takers.”\\n“With special reference to cocaine?” asked Poirot.\\n“How did you know?” I asked, somewhat surprised.\\nFor answer, the little man rose and crossed the room to where\\nnewspapers were filed. He brought me a copy of the Daily Budget, dated\\nFriday, 16th September, and showed me an article dealing with the\\nsmuggling of cocaine. It was a somewhat lurid article, written with an eye\\nto picturesque effect.\\n“That is what put cocaine into her head, my friend,” he said.\\nI would have catechized him further, for I did not quite understand his\\nmeaning, but at that moment the door opened and Geoffrey Raymond was\\nannounced.\\nHe came in fresh and debonair as ever, and greeted us both.\\n“How are you, doctor? M. Poirot, this is the second time I’ve been here\\nthis morning. I was anxious to catch you.”\\n“Perhaps I’d better be off,” I suggested rather awkwardly.\\n“Not on my account, doctor. No, it’s just this,” he went on, seating\\nhimself at a wave of invitation from Poirot, “I’ve got a confession to make.”\\n“En verité?” said Poirot, with an air of polite interest.\\n“Oh, it’s of no consequence, really. But, as a matter of fact, my\\nconscience has been pricking me ever since yesterday afternoon. You\\naccused us all of keeping back something, M. Poirot. I plead guilty. I’ve had\\nsomething up my sleeve.”\\n“And what is that, M. Raymond?”\\n“As I say, it’s nothing of consequence—just this. I was in debt—badly,\\nand that legacy came in the nick of time. Five hundred pounds puts me on\\nmy feet again with a little to spare.”\\nHe smiled at us both with that engaging frankness that made him such a\\nlikeable youngster.\\n“You know how it is. Suspicious-looking policemen—don’t like to\\nadmit you were hard up for money—think it will look bad to them. But I\\nwas a fool, really, because Blunt and I were in the billiard room from a\\nquarter to ten onwards, so I’ve got a watertight alibi and nothing to fear.\\nStill, when you thundered out that stuff about concealing things, I felt a\\nnasty prick of conscience, and I thought I’d like to get it off my mind.”\\nHe got up again and stood smiling at us.\\n“You are a very wise young man,” said Poirot, nodding at him with\\napproval. “See you, when I know that anyone is hiding things from me, I\\nsuspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed. You have\\ndone well.”\\n“I’m glad I’m cleared from suspicion,” laughed Raymond. “I’ll be off\\nnow.”\\n“So that is that,” I remarked, as the door closed behind the young\\nsecretary.\\n“Yes,” agreed Poirot. “A mere bagatelle—but if he had not been in the\\nbilliard room—who knows? After all, many crimes have been committed\\nfor the sake of less than five hundred pounds. It all depends on what sum is\\nsufficient to break a man. A question of relativity, is it not so? Have you\\nreflected, my friend, that many people in that house stood to benefit by Mr.\\nAckroyd’s death? Mrs. Ackroyd, Miss Flora, young Mr. Raymond, the\\nhousekeeper, Miss Russell. Only one, in fact, does not, Major Blunt.”\\nHis tone in uttering that name was so peculiar that I looked up, puzzled.\\n“I don’t understand you,” I said.\\n“Two of the people I accused have given me the truth.”\\n“You think Major Blunt has something to conceal also?”\\n“As for that,” remarked Poirot nonchalantly, “there is a saying, is there\\nnot, that Englishmen conceal only one thing—their love? And Major Blunt,\\nI should say, is not good at concealments.”\\n“Sometimes,” I said, “I wonder if we haven’t rather jumped to\\nconclusions on one point.”\\n“What is that?”\\n“We’ve assumed that the blackmailer of Mrs. Ferrars is necessarily the\\nmurderer of Mr. Ackroyd. Mightn’t we be mistaken?”\\nPoirot nodded energetically.\\n“Very good. Very good indeed. I wondered if that idea would come to\\nyou. Of course it is possible. But we must remember one point. The letter\\ndisappeared. Still, that, as you say, may not necessarily mean that the\\nmurderer took it. When you first found the body, Parker may have\\nabstracted the letter unnoticed by you.”\\n“Parker?”\\n“Yes, Parker. I always come back to Parker—not as the murderer—no,\\nhe did not commit the murder; but who is more suitable than he as the\\nmysterious scoundrel who terrorized Mrs. Ferrars? He may have got his\\ninformation about Mr. Ferrars’s death from one of the King’s Paddock\\nservants. At any rate, he is more likely to have come upon it than a casual\\nguest such as Blunt, for instance.”\\n“Parker might have taken the letter,” I admitted. “It wasn’t till later that\\nI noticed it was gone.”\\n“How much later? After Blunt and Raymond were in the room, or\\nbefore?”\\n“I can’t remember,” I said slowly. “I think it was before—no,\\nafterwards. Yes, I’m almost sure it was afterwards.”\\n“That widens the field to three,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “But Parker is\\nthe most likely. It is in my mind to try a little experiment with Parker. How\\nsay you, my friend, will you accompany me to Fernly?”\\nI acquiesced, and we set out at once. Poirot asked to see Miss Ackroyd,\\nand presently Flora came to us.\\n“Mademoiselle Flora,” said Poirot, “I have to confide in you a little\\nsecret. I am not yet satisfied of the innocence of Parker. I propose to make a\\nlittle experiment with your assistance. I want to reconstruct some of his\\nactions on that night. But we must think of something to tell him—ah! I\\nhave it. I wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices in the little lobby could\\nhave been heard outside on the terrace. Now, ring for Parker, if you will be\\nso good.”\\nI did so, and presently the butler appeared, suave as ever.\\n“You rang, sir?”\\n“Yes, my good Parker. I have in mind a little experiment. I have placed\\nMajor Blunt on the terrace outside the study window. I want to see if\\nanyone there could have heard the voices of Miss Ackroyd and yourself in\\nthe lobby that night. I want to enact that little scene over again. Perhaps you\\nwould fetch the tray or whatever it was you were carrying?”\\nParker vanished, and we repaired to the lobby outside the study door.\\nPresently we heard a chink in the outer hall, and Parker appeared in the\\ndoorway carrying a tray with a siphon, a decanter of whisky, and two\\nglasses on it.\\n“One moment,” cried Poirot, raising his hand and seemingly very\\nexcited. “We must have everything in order. Just as it occurred. It is a little\\nmethod of mine.”\\n“A foreign custom, sir,” said Parker. “Reconstruction of the crime they\\ncall it, do they not?”\\nHe was quite imperturbable as he stood there politely waiting on\\nPoirot’s orders.\\n“Ah! he knows something, the good Parker,” cried Poirot. “He has read\\nof these things. Now, I beg you, let us have everything of the most exact.\\nYou came from the outer hall—so. Mademoiselle was—where?”\\n“Here,” said Flora, taking up her stand just outside the study door.\\n“Quite right, sir,” said Parker.\\n“I had just closed the door,” continued Flora.\\n“Yes, miss,” agreed Parker. “Your hand was still on the handle as it is\\nnow.”\\n“Then allez,” said Poirot. “Play me the little comedy.”\\nFlora stood with her hand on the door handle, and Parker came stepping\\nthrough the door from the hall, bearing the tray.\\nHe stopped just inside the door. Flora spoke.\\n“Oh! Parker. Mr. Ackroyd doesn’t want to be disturbed again tonight.”\\n“Is that right?” she added in an undertone.\\n“To the best of my recollection, Miss Flora,” said Parker, “but I fancy\\nyou used the word evening instead of night.” Then, raising his voice in a\\nsomewhat theatrical fashion: “Very good, miss. Shall I lock up as usual?”\\n“Yes, please.”\\nParker retired through the door, Flora followed him, and started to\\nascend the main staircase.\\n“Is that enough?” she asked over her shoulder.\\n“Admirable,” declared the little man, rubbing his hands. “By the way,\\nParker, are you sure there were two glasses on the tray that evening? Who\\nwas the second one for?”\\n“I always bring two glasses, sir,” said Parker. “Is there anything\\nfurther?”\\n“Nothing. I thank you.”\\nParker withdrew, dignified to the last.\\nPoirot stood in the middle of the hall frowning. Flora came down and\\njoined us.\\n“Has your experiment been successful?” she asked. “I don’t quite\\nunderstand, you know—”\\nPoirot smiled admiringly at her.\\n“It is not necessary that you should,” he said. “But tell me, were there\\nindeed two glasses on Parker’s tray that night?”\\nFlora wrinkled her brows a minute.\\n“I really can’t remember,” she said. “I think there were. Is—is that the\\nobject of your experiment?”\\nPoirot took her hand and patted it.\\n“Put it this way,” he said. “I am always interested to see if people will\\nspeak the truth.”\\n“And did Parker speak the truth?”\\n“I rather think he did,” said Poirot thoughtfully.\\nA few minutes later saw us retracing our steps to the village.\\n“What was the point of that question about the glasses?” I asked\\ncuriously.\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n“One must say something,” he remarked. “That particular question did\\nas well as any other.”\\nI stared at him.\\n“At any rate, my friend,” he said seriously, “I know now something I\\nwanted to know. Let us leave it at that.”\\nSixteen\\nAN EVENING AT MAH JONG\\nThat night we had a little Mah Jong party. This kind of simple\\nentertainment is very popular in King’s Abbot. The guests arrive in\\ngaloshes and waterproofs after dinner. They partake of coffee and later of\\ncake, sandwiches and tea.\\nOn this particular night our guests were Miss Gannett and Colonel\\nCarter, who lives near the church. A good deal of gossip is handed round at\\nthese evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the game in progress.\\nWe used to play bridge—chatty bridge of the worst description. We find\\nMah Jong much more peaceful. The irritated demand as to why on earth\\nyour partner did not lead a certain card is entirely done away with, and\\nthough we still express criticisms frankly, there is not the same acrimonious\\nspirit.\\n“Very cold evening, eh, Sheppard?” said Colonel Carter, standing with\\nhis back to the fire. Caroline had taken Miss Gannett to her own room, and\\nwas there assisting her to disentangle herself from her many wraps.\\n“Reminds me of the Afghan passes.”\\n“Indeed?” I said politely.\\n“Very mysterious business this about poor Ackroyd,” continued the\\ncolonel, accepting a cup of coffee. “A deuce of a lot behind it—that’s what I\\nsay. Between you and me, Sheppard, I’ve heard the word blackmail\\nmentioned!”\\nThe colonel gave me the look which might be tabulated “one man of the\\nworld to another.”\\n“A woman in it, no doubt,” he said. “Depend upon it, a woman in it.”\\nCaroline and Miss Gannett joined us at this minute. Miss Gannett drank\\ncoffee whilst Caroline got out the Mah Jong box and poured out the tiles\\nupon the table.\\n“Washing the tiles,” said the colonel facetiously. “That’s right—\\nwashing the tiles, as we used to say in the Shanghai Club.”\\nIt is the private opinion of both Caroline and myself that Colonel Carter\\nhas never been in the Shanghai Club in his life. More, that he has never\\nbeen farther east than India, where he juggled with tins of bully beef and\\nplum and apple jam during the Great War. But the colonel is determinedly\\nmilitary, and in King’s Abbot we permit people to indulge their little\\nidiosyncrasies freely.\\n“Shall we begin?” said Caroline.\\nWe sat round the table. For some five minutes there was complete\\nsilence, owing to the fact that there is tremendous secret competition\\namongst us as to who can build their wall quickest.\\n“Go on, James,” said Caroline at last. “You’re East Wind.”\\nI discarded a tile. A round or two proceeded, broken by the monotonous\\nremarks of “Three Bamboos,” “Two Circles,” “Pung,” and frequently from\\nMiss Gannett “Unpung,” owing to that lady’s habit of too hastily claiming\\ntiles to which she had no right.\\n“I saw Flora Ackroyd this morning,” said Miss Gannett. “Pung—no—\\nUnpung. I made a mistake.”\\n“Four Circles,” said Caroline. “Where did you see her?”\\n“She didn’t see me,” said Miss Gannett, with that tremendous\\nsignificance only to be met with in small villages.\\n“Ah!” said Caroline interestedly. “Chow.”\\n“I believe,” said Miss Gannett, temporarily diverted, “that it’s the right\\nthing nowadays to say ‘Chee’ not ‘Chow.’”\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline. “I have always said ‘Chow.’”\\n“In the Shanghai Club,” said Colonel Carter, “they say ‘Chow.’”\\nMiss Gannett retired, crushed.\\n“What were you saying about Flora Ackroyd?” asked Caroline, after a\\nmoment or two devoted to the game. “Was she with anyone?”\\n“Very much so,” said Miss Gannett.\\nThe eyes of the two ladies met, and seemed to exchange information.\\n“Really,” said Caroline interestedly. “Is that it? Well, it doesn’t surprise\\nme in the least.”\\n“We’re waiting for you to discard, Miss Caroline,” said the colonel. He\\nsometimes affects the pose of the bluff male, intent on the game and\\nindifferent to gossip. But nobody is deceived.\\n“If you ask me,” said Miss Gannett. (“Was that a Bamboo you\\ndiscarded, dear? Oh! no, I see now—it was a Circle.) As I was saying, if\\nyou ask me, Flora’s been exceedingly lucky. Exceedingly lucky she’s been.”\\n“How’s that, Miss Gannett?” asked the colonel. “I’ll Pung that Green\\nDragon. How do you make out that Miss Flora’s been lucky? Very\\ncharming girl and all that, I know.”\\n“I mayn’t know very much about crime,” said Miss Gannett, with the\\nair of one who knows everything there is to know, “but I can tell you one\\nthing. The first question that’s always asked is ‘Who last saw the deceased\\nalive?’ And the person who did is regarded with suspicion. Now, Flora\\nAckroyd last saw her uncle alive. It might have looked very nasty for her—\\nvery nasty indeed. It’s my opinion—and I give it for what it’s worth, that\\nRalph Paton is staying away on her account, to draw suspicion away from\\nher.”\\n“Come, now,” I protested mildly, “you surely can’t suggest that a young\\ngirl like Flora Ackroyd is capable of stabbing her uncle in cold blood?”\\n“Well, I don’t know,” said Miss Gannett. “I’ve just been reading a book\\nfrom the library about the underworld of Paris, and it says that some of the\\nworst women criminals are young girls with the faces of angels.”\\n“That’s in France,” said Caroline instantly.\\n“Just so,” said the colonel. “Now, I’ll tell you a very curious thing—a\\nstory that was going round the Bazaars in India….”\\nThe colonel’s story was one of interminable length, and of curiously\\nlittle interest. A thing that happened in India many years ago cannot\\ncompare for a moment with an event that took place in King’s Abbot the\\nday before yesterday.\\nIt was Caroline who brought the colonel’s story to a close by fortunately\\ngoing Mah Jong. After the slight unpleasantness always caused by my\\ncorrections of Caroline’s somewhat faulty arithmetic, we started a new\\nhand.\\n“East Wind passes,” said Caroline. “I’ve got an idea of my own about\\nRalph Paton. Three Characters. But I’m keeping it to myself for the\\npresent.”\\n“Are you, dear?” said Miss Gannett. “Chow—I mean Pung.”\\n“Yes,” said Caroline firmly.\\n“Was it all right about the boots?” asked Miss Gannett. “Their being\\nblack, I mean?”\\n“Quite all right,” said Caroline.\\n“What was the point, do you think?” asked Miss Gannett.\\nCaroline pursed up her lips, and shook her head with an air of knowing\\nall about it.\\n“Pung,” said Miss Gannett. “No—Unpung. I suppose that now the\\ndoctor’s in with M. Poirot he knows all the secrets?”\\n“Far from it,” I said.\\n“James is so modest,” said Caroline. “Ah! A concealed Kong.”\\nThe colonel gave vent to a whistle. For the moment gossip was\\nforgotten.\\n“Your own wind, too,” he said. “And you’ve got two Pungs of Dragons.\\nWe must be careful. Miss Caroline’s out for a big hand.”\\nWe played for some minutes with no irrelevant conversation.\\n“This M. Poirot now,” said Colonel Carter, “is he really such a great\\ndetective?”\\n“The greatest the world has ever known,” said Caroline solemnly. “He\\nhas to come here incognito to avoid publicity.”\\n“Chow,” said Miss Gannett. “Quite wonderful for our little village, I’m\\nsure. By the way, Clara—my maid, you know—is great friends with Elsie,\\nthe housemaid at Fernly, and what do you think Elsie told her? That there’s\\nbeen a lot of money stolen, and it’s her opinion—Elsie’s, I mean—that the\\nparlourmaid had something to do with it. She’s leaving at the month, and\\nshe’s crying a good deal at night. If you ask me, the girl is very likely in\\nleague with a gang. She’s always been a queer girl—she’s not friends with\\nany of the girls round here. She goes off by herself on her days out—very\\nunnatural, I call it, and most suspicious. I asked her once to come to our\\nFriendly Girls’ Evenings, but she refused, and then I asked her a few\\nquestions about her home and her family—all that sort of thing, and I’m\\nbound to say I considered her manner most impertinent. Outwardly very\\nrespectful—but she shut me up in the most barefaced way.”\\nMiss Gannett stopped for breath, and the colonel, who was totally\\nuninterested in the servant question, remarked that in the Shanghai Club\\nbrisk play was the invariable rule.\\nWe had a round of brisk play.\\n“That Miss Russell,” said Caroline. “She came here pretending to\\nconsult James on Friday morning. It’s my opinion she wanted to see where\\nthe poisons were kept. Five Characters.”\\n“Chow,” said Miss Gannett. “What an extraordinary idea! I wonder if\\nyou can be right.”\\n“Talking of poisons,” said the colonel. “Eh—what? Haven’t I\\ndiscarded? Oh! Eight Bamboos.”\\n“Mah Jong!” said Miss Gannett.\\nCaroline was very much annoyed.\\n“One Red Dragon,” she said regretfully, “and I should have had a hand\\nof three doubles.”\\n“I’ve had two Red Dragons all the time,” I mentioned.\\n“So exactly like you, James,” said Caroline reproachfully. “You’ve no\\nconception of the spirit of the game.”\\nI myself thought I had played rather cleverly. I should have had to pay\\nCaroline an enormous amount if she had gone Mah Jong. Miss Gannett’s\\nMah Jong was of the poorest variety possible, as Caroline did not fail to\\npoint out to her.\\nEast Wind passed, and we started a new hand in silence.\\n“What I was going to tell you just now was this,” said Caroline.\\n“Yes?” said Miss Gannett encouragingly.\\n“My idea about Ralph Paton, I mean.”\\n“Yes, dear,” said Miss Gannett, still more encouragingly. “Chow!”\\n“It’s a sign of weakness to Chow so early,” said Caroline severely. “You\\nshould go for a big hand.”\\n“I know,” said Miss Gannett. “You were saying—about Ralph Paton,\\nyou know?”\\n“Yes. Well, I’ve a pretty shrewd idea where he is.”\\nWe all stopped to stare at her.\\n“This is very interesting, Miss Caroline,” said Colonel Carter. “All your\\nown idea, eh?”\\n“Well, not exactly. I’ll tell you about it. You know that big map of the\\ncounty we have in the hall?”\\nWe all said Yes.\\n“As M. Poirot was going out the other day, he stopped and looked at it,\\nand he made some remark—I can’t remember exactly what it was.\\nSomething about Cranchester being the only big town anywhere near us—\\nwhich is true, of course. But after he had gone—it came to me suddenly.”\\n“What came to you?”\\n“His meaning. Of course Ralph is in Cranchester.”\\nIt was at that moment that I knocked down the rack that held my pieces.\\nMy sister immediately reproved me for clumsiness, but half-heartedly. She\\nwas intent on her theory.\\n“Cranchester, Miss Caroline?” said Colonel Carter. “Surely not\\nCranchester! It’s so near.”\\n“That’s exactly it,” cried Caroline triumphantly. “It seems quite clear by\\nnow that he didn’t get away from here by train. He must simply have\\nwalked into Cranchester. And I believe he’s there still. No one would dream\\nof his being so near at hand.”\\nI pointed out several objections to the theory, but when once Caroline\\nhas got something firmly into her head, nothing dislodges it.\\n“And you think M. Poirot has the same idea,” said Miss Gannett\\nthoughtfully. “It’s a curious coincidence, but I was out for a walk this\\nafternoon on the Cranchester road, and he passed me in a car coming from\\nthat direction.”\\nWe all looked at each other.\\n“Why, dear me,” said Miss Gannett suddenly, “I’m Mah Jong all the\\ntime, and I never noticed it.”\\nCaroline’s attention was distracted from her own inventive exercises.\\nShe pointed out to Miss Gannett that a hand consisting of mixed suits and\\ntoo many Chows was hardly worth going Mah Jong on. Miss Gannett\\nlistened imperturbably and collected her counters.\\n“Yes, dear, I know what you mean,” she said. “But it rather depends on\\nwhat kind of a hand you have to start with, doesn’t it?”\\n“You’ll never get the big hands if you don’t go for them,” urged\\nCaroline.\\n“Well, we must all play our own way, mustn’t we?” said Miss Gannett.\\nShe looked down at her counters. “After all, I’m up, so far.”\\nCaroline, who was considerably down, said nothing.\\nEast Wind passed, and we set to once more. Annie brought in the tea\\nthings. Caroline and Miss Gannett were both slightly ruffled as is often the\\ncase during one of these festive evenings.\\n“If you would only play a leetle quicker, dear,” said Caroline, as Miss\\nGannett hesitated over her discard. “The Chinese put down the tiles so\\nquickly it sounds like little birds pattering.”\\nFor some minutes we played like the Chinese.\\n“You haven’t contributed much to the sum of information, Sheppard,”\\nsaid Colonel Carter genially. “You’re a sly dog. Hand in glove with the\\ngreat detective, and not a hint as to the way things are going.”\\n“James is an extraordinary creature,” said Caroline. “He can not bring\\nhimself to part with information.”\\nShe looked at me with some disfavour.\\n“I assure you,” I said, “that I don’t know anything. Poirot keeps his own\\ncounsel.”\\n“Wise man,” said the colonel with a chuckle. “He doesn’t give himself\\naway. But they’re wonderful fellows, these foreign detectives. Up to all\\nsorts of dodges, I believe.”\\n“Pung,” said Miss Gannett, in a tone of quiet triumph. “And Mah Jong.”\\nThe situation became more strained. It was annoyance at Miss Gannett’s\\ngoing Mah Jong for the third time running which prompted Caroline to say\\nto me as we built a fresh wall:\\n“You are too tiresome, James. You sit there like a deadhead, and say\\nnothing at all!”\\n“But, my dear,” I protested, “I have really nothing to say—that is, of the\\nkind you mean.”\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline, as she sorted her hand. “You must know\\nsomething interesting.”\\nI did not answer for a moment. I was overwhelmed and intoxicated. I\\nhad read of there being such a thing as The Perfect Winning—going Mah\\nJong on one’s original hand. I had never hoped to hold the hand myself.\\nWith suppressed triumph I laid my hand face upwards on the table.\\n“As they say in the Shanghai Club,” I remarked—“Tin-ho—the Perfect\\nWinning!”\\nThe colonel’s eyes nearly bulged out of his head.\\n“Upon my soul,” he said. “what an extraordinary thing. I never saw that\\nhappen before!”\\nIt was then that I went on, goaded by Caroline’s gibes, and rendered\\nreckless by my triumph.\\n“And as to anything interesting,” I said. “What about a gold wedding\\nring with a date and ‘From R.’ inside.”\\nI pass over the scene that followed. I was made to say exactly where\\nthis treasure was found. I was made to reveal the date.\\n“March 13th,” said Caroline. “Just six months ago. Ah!”\\nOut of a babel of excited suggestions and suppositions three theories\\nwere evolved:\\n1. That of Colonel Carter: that Ralph was secretly married to Flora. The\\nfirst or most simple solution.\\n2. That of Miss Gannett: that Roger Ackroyd had been secretly married\\nto Mrs. Ferrars.\\n3. That of my sister: that Roger Ackroyd had married his housekeeper,\\nMiss Russell.\\nA fourth or super theory was propounded by Caroline later as we went\\nup to bed.\\n“Mark my words,” she said suddenly, “I shouldn’t be at all surprised if\\nGeoffrey Raymond and Flora weren’t married.”\\n“Surely it would be ‘From G.,’ not ‘From R.’ then,” I suggested.\\n“You never know. Some girls call men by their surnames. And you\\nheard what Miss Gannett said this evening—about Flora’s carryings on.”\\nStrictly speaking, I had not heard Miss Gannett say anything of the\\nkind, but I respected Caroline’s knowledge of innuendoes.\\n“How about Hector Blunt?” I hinted. “If it’s anybody—”\\n“Nonsense,” said Caroline. “I dare say he admires her—may even be in\\nlove with her. But depend upon it a girl isn’t going to fall in love with a man\\nold enough to be her father when there’s a good-looking secretary about.\\nShe may encourage Major Blunt just as a blind. Girls are very artful. But\\nthere’s one thing I do tell you, James Sheppard. Flora Ackroyd does not\\ncare a penny piece for Ralph Paton, and never has. You can take it from\\nme.”\\nI took it from her meekly.\\nSeventeen\\nPARKER\\nIt occurred to me the next morning that under the exhilaration produced by\\nTin-ho or the Perfect Winning, I might have been slightly indiscreet. True,\\nPoirot had not asked me to keep the discovery of the ring to myself. On the\\nother hand, he had said nothing about it whilst at Fernly, and as far as I\\nknew, I was the only person aware that it had been found. I felt distinctly\\nguilty. The fact was by now spreading through King’s Abbot like wildfire. I\\nwas expecting wholesale reproaches from Poirot any minute.\\nThe joint funeral of Mrs. Ferrars and Roger Ackroyd was fixed for\\neleven o’clock. It was a melancholy and impressive ceremony. All the party\\nfrom Fernly were there.\\nAfter it was over, Poirot, who had also been present, took me by the\\narm, and invited me to accompany him back to The Larches. He was\\nlooking very grave, and I feared that my indiscretion of the night before had\\ngot round to his ears. But it soon transpired that his thoughts were occupied\\nby something of a totally different nature.\\n“See you,” he said. “We must act. With your help I propose to examine\\na witness. We will question him, we will put such fear into him that the\\ntruth is bound to come out.”\\n“What witness are you talking about?” I asked, very much surprised.\\n“Parker!” said Poirot. “I asked him to be at my house this morning at\\ntwelve o’clock. He should await us there at this very minute.”\\n“What do you think?” I ventured, glancing sideways at his face.\\n“I know this—that I am not satisfied.”\\n“You think that it was he who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars?”\\n“Either that, or—”\\n“Well?” I said, after waiting a minute or two.\\n“My friend, I will say this to you—I hope it was he.”\\nThe gravity of his manner, and something indefinable that tinged it,\\nreduced me to silence.\\nOn arrival at The Larches, we were informed that Parker was already\\nthere awaiting our return. As we entered the room, the butler rose\\nrespectfully.\\n“Good morning, Parker,” said Poirot pleasantly. “One instant, I pray of\\nyou.”\\nHe removed his overcoat and gloves.\\n“Allow me, sir,” said Parker, and sprang forward to assist him. He\\ndeposited the articles neatly on a chair by the door. Poirot watched him with\\napproval.\\n“Thank you, my good Parker,” he said. “Take a seat, will you not? What\\nI have to say may take some time.”\\nParker seated himself with an apologetic bend of the head.\\n“Now what do you think I asked you to come here for this morning—\\neh?”\\nParker coughed.\\n“I understood, sir, that you wished to ask me a few questions about my\\nlate master—private like.”\\n“Précisément,” said Poirot, beaming. “Have you made many\\nexperiments in blackmail?”\\n“Sir!”\\nThe butler sprang to his feet.\\n“Do not excite yourself,” said Poirot placidly. “Do not play the farce of\\nthe honest, injured man. You know all there is to know about the blackmail,\\nis it not so?”\\n“Sir, I—I’ve never—never been—”\\n“Insulted,” suggested Poirot, “in such a way before. Then why, my\\nexcellent Parker, were you so anxious to overhear the conversation in Mr.\\nAckroyd’s study the other evening, after you had caught the word\\nblackmail?”\\n“I wasn’t—I—”\\n“Who was your last master?” rapped out Poirot suddenly.\\n“My last master?”\\n“Yes, the master you were with before you came to Mr. Ackroyd.”\\n“A Major Ellerby, sir—”\\nPoirot took the words out of his mouth.\\n“Just so, Major Ellerby. Major Ellerby was addicted to drugs, was he\\nnot? You travelled about with him. When he was in Bermuda there was\\nsome trouble—a man was killed. Major Ellerby was partly responsible. It\\nwas hushed up. But you knew about it. How much did Major Ellerby pay\\nyou to keep your mouth shut?”\\nParker was staring at him openmouthed. The man had gone to pieces,\\nhis cheeks shook flabbily.\\n“You see, me, I have made inquiries,” said Poirot pleasantly. “It is as I\\nsay. You got a good sum then as blackmail, and Major Ellerby went on\\npaying you until he died. Now I want to hear about your latest experiment.”\\nParker still stared.\\n“It is useless to deny. Hercule Poirot knows. It is so, what I have said\\nabout Major Ellerby, is it not?”\\nAs though against his will, Parker nodded reluctantly once. His face\\nwas ashen pale.\\n“But I never hurt a hair of Mr. Ackroyd’s head,” he moaned. “Honest to\\nGod, sir, I didn’t. I’ve been afraid of this coming all the time. And I tell you\\nI didn’t—I didn’t kill him.”\\nHis voice rose almost to a scream.\\n“I am inclined to believe you, my friend,” said Poirot. “You have not the\\nnerve—the courage. But I must have the truth.”\\n“I’ll tell you anything, sir, anything you want to know. It’s true that I\\ntried to listen that night. A word or two I heard made me curious. And Mr.\\nAckroyd’s wanting not to be disturbed, and shutting himself up with the\\ndoctor the way he did. It’s God’s own truth what I told the police. I heard\\nthe word blackmail, sir, and well—”\\nHe paused.\\n“You thought there might be something in it for you?” suggested Poirot\\nsmoothly.\\n“Well—well, yes, I did, sir. I thought that if Mr. Ackroyd was being\\nblackmailed, why shouldn’t I have a share of the pickings?”\\nA very curious expression passed over Poirot’s face. He leaned forward.\\n“Had you any reason to suppose before that night that Mr. Ackroyd was\\nbeing blackmailed?”\\n“No, indeed, sir. It was a great surprise to me. Such a regular gentleman\\nin all his habits.”\\n“How much did you overhear?”\\n“Not very much, sir. There seemed what I might call a spite against me.\\nOf course I had to attend to my duties in the pantry. And when I did creep\\nalong once or twice to the study it was no use. The first time Dr. Sheppard\\ncame out and almost caught me in the act, and another time Mr. Raymond\\npassed me in the big hall and went that way, so I knew it was no use; and\\nwhen I went with the tray, Miss Flora headed me off.”\\nPoirot stared for a long time at the man, as if to test his sincerity. Parker\\nreturned his gaze earnestly.\\n“I hope you believe me, sir. I’ve been afraid all along the police would\\nrake up that old business with Major Ellerby and be suspicious of me in\\nconsequence.”\\n“Eh bien,” said Poirot at last. “I am disposed to believe you. But there\\nis one thing I must request of you—to show me your bankbook. You have a\\nbankbook, I presume?”\\n“Yes, sir, as a matter of fact, I have it with me now.”\\nWith no sign of confusion, he produced it from his pocket. Poirot took\\nthe slim, green-covered book and perused the entries.\\n“Ah! I perceive you have purchased £500 worth of National Savings\\nCertificates this year?”\\n“Yes, sir. I have already over a thousand pounds saved—the result of\\nmy connection with—er—my late master, Major Ellerby. And I have had\\nquite a little flutter on some horses this year—very successful. If you\\nremember, sir, a rank outsider won the Jubilee. I was fortunate enough to\\nback it—£20.”\\nPoirot handed him back the book.\\n“I will wish you good morning. I believe that you have told me the\\ntruth. If you have not—so much the worse for you, my friend.”\\nWhen Parker had departed, Poirot picked up his overcoat once more.\\n“Going out again?” I asked.\\n“Yes, we will pay a little visit to the good M. Hammond.”\\n“You believe Parker’s story?”\\n“It is credible enough on the face of it. It seems clear that—unless he is\\na very good actor indeed—he genuinely believes it was Ackroyd himself\\nwho was the victim of blackmail. If so, he knows nothing at all about the\\nMrs. Ferrars business.”\\n“Then in that case—who—?”\\n“Précisément! Who? But our visit to M. Hammond will accomplish one\\npurpose. It will either clear Parker completely or else—”\\n“Well?”\\n“I fall into the bad habit of leaving my sentences unfinished this\\nmorning,” said Poirot apologetically. “You must bear with me.”\\n“By the way,” I said, rather sheepishly, “I’ve got a confession to make.\\nI’m afraid I have inadvertently let out something about that ring.”\\n“What ring?”\\n“The ring you found in the goldfish pond.”\\n“Ah! yes,” said Poirot, smiling broadly.\\n“I hope you’re not annoyed? It was very careless of me.”\\n“But not at all, my good friend, not at all. I laid no commands upon you.\\nYou were at liberty to speak of it if you so wished. She was interested, your\\nsister?”\\n“She was indeed. It created a sensation. All sorts of theories are flying\\nabout.”\\n“Ah! And yet it is so simple. The true explanation leapt to the eye, did it\\nnot?”\\n“Did it?” I said drily.\\nPoirot laughed.\\n“The wise man does not commit himself,” he observed. “Is not that so?\\nBut here we are at Mr. Hammond’s.”\\nThe lawyer was in his office, and we were ushered in without any delay.\\nHe rose and greeted us in his dry, precise manner.\\nPoirot came at once to the point.\\n“Monsieur, I desire from you certain information, that is, if you will be\\nso good as to give it to me. You acted, I understand, for the late Mrs. Ferrars\\nof King’s Paddock?”\\nI noticed the swift gleam of surprise which showed in the lawyer’s eyes,\\nbefore his professional reserve came down once more like a mask over his\\nface.\\n“Certainly. All her affairs passed through our hands.”\\n“Very good. Now, before I ask you to tell me anything, I should like you\\nto listen to the story Dr. Sheppard will relate to you. You have no objection,\\nhave you, my friend, to repeating the conversation you had with Mr.\\nAckroyd last Friday night?”\\n“Not in the least,” I said, and straightway began the recital of that\\nstrange evening.\\nHammond listened with close attention.\\n“That is all,” I said, when I had finished.\\n“Blackmail,” said the lawyer thoughtfully.\\n“You are surprised?” asked Poirot.\\nThe lawyer took off his pince-nez and polished them with his\\nhandkerchief.\\n“No,” he replied, “I can hardly say that I am surprised. I have suspected\\nsomething of the kind for some time.”\\n“That brings us,” said Poirot, “to the information for which I am asking.\\nIf anyone can give us an idea of the actual sums paid, you are the man,\\nmonsieur.”\\n“I see no object in withholding the information,” said Hammond, after a\\nmoment or two. “During the past year, Mrs. Ferrars has sold out certain\\nsecurities, and the money for them was paid into her account and not\\nreinvested. As her income was a large one, and she lived very quietly after\\nher husband’s death, it seems certain that these sums of money were paid\\naway for some special purpose. I once sounded her on the subject, and she\\nsaid that she was obliged to support several of her husband’s poor relations.\\nI let the matter drop, of course. Until now, I have always imagined that the\\nmoney was paid to some woman who had had a claim on Ashley Ferrars. I\\nnever dreamed that Mrs. Ferrars herself was involved.”\\n“And the amount?” asked Poirot.\\n“In all, I should say the various sums totalled at least twenty thousand\\npounds.”\\n“Twenty thousand pounds!” I exclaimed. “In one year!”\\n“Mrs. Ferrars was a very wealthy woman,” said Poirot drily. “And the\\npenalty for murder is not a pleasant one.”\\n“Is there anything else that I can tell you?” inquired Mr. Hammond.\\n“I thank you, no,” said Poirot, rising. “All my excuses for having\\nderanged you.”\\n“Not at all, not at all.”\\n“The word derange,” I remarked, when we were outside again, “is\\napplicable to mental disorder only.”\\n“Ah!” cried Poirot. “Never will my English be quite perfect. A curious\\nlanguage. I should then have said disarranged, n’est-ce pas?”\\n“Disturbed is the word you had in mind.”\\n“I thank you, my friend. The word exact, you are zealous for it. Eh bien,\\nwhat about our friend Parker now? With twenty thousand pounds in hand,\\nwould he have continued being a butler? Je ne pense pas. It is, of course,\\npossible that he banked the money under another name, but I am disposed\\nto believe he spoke the truth to us. If he is a scoundrel, he is a scoundrel on\\na mean scale. He has not the big ideas. That leaves us as a possibility,\\nRaymond, or—well—Major Blunt.”\\n“Surely not Raymond,” I objected. “Since we know that he was\\ndesperately hard up for a matter of five hundred pounds.”\\n“That is what he says, yes.”\\n“And as to Hector Blunt—”\\n“I will tell you something as to the good Major Blunt,” interrupted\\nPoirot. “It is my business to make inquiries. I make them. Eh bien—that\\nlegacy of which he speaks, I have discovered that the amount of it was close\\nupon twenty thousand pounds. What do you think of that?”\\nI was so taken aback that I could hardly speak.\\n“It’s impossible,” I said at last. “A well-known man like Hector Blunt.”\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders.\\n“Who knows? At least he is a man with big ideas. I confess that I hardly\\nsee him as a blackmailer, but there is another possibility that you have not\\neven considered.”\\n“What is that?”\\n“The fire, my friend. Ackroyd himself may have destroyed that letter,\\nblue envelope and all, after you left him.”\\n“I hardly think that likely,” I said slowly. “And yet—of course, it may\\nbe so. He might have changed his mind.”\\nWe had just arrived at my house, and on the spur of the moment I\\ninvited Poirot to come in and take pot luck.\\nI thought Caroline would be pleased with me, but it is hard to satisfy\\none’s womenfolk. It appears that we were eating chops for lunch—the\\nkitchen staff being regaled on tripe and onions. And two chops set before\\nthree people are productive of embarrassment.\\nBut Caroline is seldom daunted for long. With magnificent mendacity,\\nshe explained to Poirot that although James laughed at her for doing so, she\\nadhered strictly to a vegetarian diet. She descanted ecstatically on the\\ndelights of nut cutlets (which I am quite sure she has never tasted) and ate a\\nWelsh rarebit with gusto and frequent cutting remarks as to the dangers of\\n“flesh” foods.\\nAfterwards, when we were sitting in front of the fire and smoking,\\nCaroline attacked Poirot directly.\\n“Not found Ralph Paton yet?” she asked.\\n“Where should I find him, mademoiselle?”\\n“I thought, perhaps, you’d found him in Cranchester,” said Caroline,\\nwith intense meaning in her tone.\\nPoirot looked merely bewildered.\\n“In Cranchester? But why in Cranchester?”\\nI enlightened him with a touch of malice.\\n“One of our ample staff of private detectives happened to see you in a\\ncar on the Cranchester road yesterday,” I explained.\\nPoirot’s bewilderment vanished. He laughed heartily.\\n“Ah, that! A simple visit to the dentist, c’est tout. My tooth, it aches. I\\ngo there. My tooth, it is at once better. I think to return quickly. The dentist,\\nhe says No. Better to have it out. I argue. He insists. He has his way! That\\nparticular tooth, it will never ache again.”\\nCaroline collapsed rather like a pricked balloon.\\nWe fell to discussing Ralph Paton.\\n“A weak nature,” I insisted. “But not a vicious one.”\\n“Ah!” said Poirot. “But weakness, where does it end?”\\n“Exactly,” said Caroline. “Take James here—weak as water, if I weren’t\\nabout to look after him.”\\n“My dear Caroline,” I said irritably, “can’t you talk without dragging in\\npersonalities?”\\n“You are weak, James,” said Caroline, quite unmoved. “I’m eight years\\nolder than you are—oh! I don’t mind M. Poirot knowing that—”\\n“I should never have guessed it, mademoiselle,” said Poirot, with a\\ngallant little bow.\\n“Eight years older. And I’ve always considered it my duty to look after\\nyou. With a bad bringing up, Heaven knows what mischief you might have\\ngot into by now.”\\n“I might have married a beautiful adventuress,” I murmured, gazing at\\nthe ceiling, and blowing smoke rings.\\n“Adventuress!” said Caroline, with a snort. “If we’re talking of\\nadventuresses—”\\nShe left the sentence unfinished.\\n“Well?” I said, with some curiosity.\\n“Nothing. But I can think of someone not a hundred miles away.”\\nThen she turned to Poirot suddenly.\\n“James sticks to it that you believe someone in the house committed the\\nmurder. All I can say is, you’re wrong.”\\n“I should not like to be wrong,” said Poirot. “It is not—how do you say\\n—my métier?”\\n“I’ve got the facts pretty clearly,” continued Caroline, taking no notice\\nof Poirot’s remark, “from James and others. As far as I can see, of the\\npeople in the house, only two could have had the chance of doing it. Ralph\\nPaton and Flora Ackroyd.”\\n“My dear Caroline—”\\n“Now, James, don’t interrupt me. I know what I’m talking about. Parker\\nmet her outside the door, didn’t he? He didn’t hear her uncle saying\\ngoodnight to her. She could have killed him then and there.”\\n“Caroline!”\\n“I’m not saying she did, James. I’m saying she could have done. As a\\nmatter of fact, though, Flora is like all these young girls nowadays, with no\\nveneration for their betters and thinking they know best on every subject\\nunder the sun, I don’t for a minute believe she’d kill even a chicken. But\\nthere it is. Mr. Raymond and Major Blunt have alibis. Mrs. Ackroyd’s got\\nan alibi. Even that Russell woman seems to have one—and a good job for\\nher it is she has. Who is left? Only Ralph and Flora! And say what you will,\\nI don’t believe Ralph Paton is a murderer. A boy we’ve known all our\\nlives.”\\nPoirot was silent for a minute, watching the curling smoke rise from his\\ncigarette. When at last he spoke, it was in a gentle far-away voice that\\nproduced a curious impression. It was totally unlike his usual manner.\\n“Let us take a man—a very ordinary man. A man with no idea of\\nmurder in his heart. There is in him somewhere a strain of weakness—deep\\ndown. It has so far never been called into play. Perhaps it never will be—\\nand if so he will go to his grave honoured and respected by everyone. But\\nlet us suppose that something occurs. He is in difficulties—or perhaps not\\nthat even. He may stumble by accident on a secret—a secret involving life\\nor death to someone. And his first impulse will be to speak out—to do his\\nduty as an honest citizen. And then the strain of weakness tells. Here is a\\nchance of money—a great amount of money. He wants money—he desires\\nit—and it is so easy. He has to do nothing for it—just keep silence. That is\\nthe beginning. The desire for money grows. He must have more—and\\nmore! He is intoxicated by the gold mine which has opened at his feet. He\\nbecomes greedy. And in his greed he overreaches himself. One can press a\\nman as far as one likes—but with a woman one must not press too far. For a\\nwoman has at heart a great desire to speak the truth. How many husbands\\nwho have deceived their wives go comfortably to their graves, carrying\\ntheir secret with them! How many wives who have deceived their husbands\\nwreck their lives by throwing the fact in those same husbands’ teeth! They\\nhave been pressed too far. In a reckless moment (which they will afterwards\\nregret, bien entendu) they fling safety to the winds and turn at bay,\\nproclaiming the truth with great momentary satisfaction to themselves. So it\\nwas, I think, in this case. The strain was too great. And so there came your\\nproverb, the death of the goose that laid the golden eggs. But that is not the\\nend. Exposure faced the man of whom we are speaking. And he is not the\\nsame man he was—say, a year ago. His moral fibre is blunted. He is\\ndesperate. He is fighting a losing battle, and he is prepared to take any\\nmeans that come to his hand, for exposure means ruin to him. And so—the\\ndagger strikes!”\\nHe was silent for a moment. It was as though he had laid a spell upon\\nthe room. I cannot try to describe the impression his words produced. There\\nwas something in the merciless analysis, and the ruthless power of vision\\nwhich struck fear into both of us.\\n“Afterwards,” he went on softly, “the dagger removed, he will be\\nhimself again, normal, kindly. But if the need again arises, then once more\\nhe will strike.”\\nCaroline roused herself at last.\\n“You are speaking of Ralph Paton,” she said. “You may be right, you\\nmay not, but you have no business to condemn a man unheard.”\\nThe telephone bell rang sharply. I went out into the hall, and took off\\nthe receiver.\\n“What?” I said. “Yes. Dr. Sheppard speaking.”\\nI listened for a minute or two, then replied briefly. Replacing the\\nreceiver, I went back into the drawing room.\\n“Poirot,” I said, “they have detained a man at Liverpool. His name is\\nCharles Kent, and he is believed to be the stranger who visited Fernly that\\nnight. They want me to go to Liverpool at once and identify him.”\\nEighteen\\nCHARLES KENT\\nHalf an hour later saw Poirot, myself, and Inspector Raglan in the train on\\nthe way to Liverpool. The inspector was clearly very excited.\\n“We may get a line on the blackmailing part of the business, if on\\nnothing else,” he declared jubilantly. “He’s a rough customer, this fellow, by\\nwhat I heard over the phone. Takes dope, too. We ought to find it easy to get\\nwhat we want out of him. If there was the shadow of a motive, nothing’s\\nmore likely than that he killed Mr. Ackroyd. But in that case, why is young\\nPaton keeping out of the way. The whole thing’s a muddle—that’s what it\\nis. By the way, M. Poirot, you were quite right about those fingerprints.\\nThey were Mr. Ackroyd’s own. I had rather the same idea myself, but I\\ndismissed it as hardly feasible.”\\nI smiled to myself. Inspector Raglan was so very plainly saving his face.\\n“As regard this man,” said Poirot, “he is not yet arrested, eh?”\\n“No, detained under suspicion.”\\n“And what account does he give of himself?”\\n“Precious little,” said the inspector, with a grin. “He’s a wary bird, I\\ngather. A lot of abuse, but very little more.”\\nOn arrival at Liverpool I was surprised to find that Poirot was\\nwelcomed with acclamation. Superintendent Hayes, who met us, had\\nworked with Poirot over some case long ago, and had evidently an\\nexaggerated opinion of his powers.\\n“Now we’ve got M. Poirot here we shan’t be long,” he said cheerfully.\\n“I thought you’d retired, moosior?”\\n“So I had, my good Hayes, so I had. But how tedious is retirement! You\\ncannot imagine to yourself the monotony with which day comes after day.”\\n“Very likely. So you’ve come to have a look at our own particular find?\\nIs this Dr. Sheppard? Think you’ll be able to identify him, sir?”\\n“I’m not very sure,” I said doubtfully.\\n“How did you get hold of him?” inquired Poirot.\\n“Description was circulated, as you know. In the press and privately.\\nNot much to go on, I admit. This fellow has an American accent all right,\\nand he doesn’t deny that he was near King’s Abbot that night. Just asks\\nwhat the hell it is to do with us, and that he’ll see us in—before he answers\\nany questions.”\\n“Is it permitted that I, too, see him?” asked Poirot.\\nThe superintendent closed one eye knowingly.\\n“Very glad to have you, sir. You’ve got permission to do anything you\\nplease. Inspector Japp of Scotland Yard was asking after you the other day.\\nSaid he’d heard you were connected unofficially with this case. Where’s\\nCaptain Paton hiding, sir, can you tell me that?”\\n“I doubt if it would be wise at the present juncture,” said Poirot primly,\\nand I bit my lips to prevent a smile.\\nThe little man really did it very well.\\nAfter some further parley, we were taken to interview the prisoner.\\nHe was a young fellow, I should say not more than twenty-two or three.\\nTall, thin, with slightly shaking hands, and the evidences of considerable\\nphysical strength somewhat run to seed. His hair was dark, but his eyes\\nwere blue and shifty, seldom meeting a glance squarely. I had all along\\ncherished the illusion that there was something familiar about the figure I\\nhad met that night, but if this were indeed he, I was completely mistaken.\\nHe did not remind me in the least of anyone I knew.\\n“Now then, Kent,” said the superintendent. “Stand up. Here are some\\nvisitors come to see you. Recognize any of them?”\\nKent glared at us sullenly, but did not reply. I saw his glance waver over\\nthe three of us, and come back to rest on me.\\n“Well, sir,” said the superintendent to me, “what do you say?”\\n“The height’s the same,” I said, “and as far as general appearance goes\\nit might well be the man in question. Beyond that, I couldn’t go.”\\n“What the hell’s the meaning of all this?” asked Kent. “What have you\\ngot against me? Come on, out with it! What am I supposed to have done?”\\nI nodded my head.\\n“It’s the man,” I said. “I recognize the voice.”\\n“Recognize my voice, do you? Where do you think you heard it\\nbefore?”\\n“On Friday evening last, outside the gates of Fernly Park. You asked me\\nthe way there.”\\n“I did, did I?”\\n“Do you admit it?” asked the inspector.\\n“I don’t admit anything. Not till I know what you’ve got on me.”\\n“Have you not read the papers in the last few days?” asked Poirot,\\nspeaking for the first time.\\nThe man’s eyes narrowed.\\n“So that’s it, is it? I saw an old gent had been croaked at Fernly. Trying\\nto make out I did the job, are you?”\\n“You were there that night,” said Poirot quietly.\\n“How do you know, mister?”\\n“By this.” Poirot took something from his pocket and held it out.\\nIt was the goose quill we had found in the summer house.\\nAt the sight of it the man’s face changed. He half held out his hand.\\n“Snow,” said Poirot thoughtfully. “No, my friend, it is empty. It lay\\nwhere you dropped it in the summer house that night.”\\nCharles Kent looked at him uncertainly.\\n“You seem to know a hell of a lot about everything, you little foreign\\ncock duck. Perhaps you remember this: the papers say that the old gent was\\ncroaked between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock?”\\n“That is so,” agreed Poirot.\\n“Yes, but is it really so? That’s what I’m getting at.”\\n“This gentleman will tell you,” said Poirot.\\nHe indicated Inspector Raglan. The latter hesitated, glanced at\\nSuperintendent Hayes, then at Poirot, and finally, as though receiving\\nsanction, he said:\\n“That’s right. Between a quarter to ten and ten o’clock.”\\n“Then you’ve nothing to keep me here for,” said Kent. “I was away\\nfrom Fernly Park by twenty-five minutes past nine. You can ask at the Dog\\nand Whistle. That’s a saloon about a mile out of Fernly on the road to\\nCranchester. I kicked up a bit of a row there, I remember. As near as\\nnothing to quarter to ten, it was. How about that?”\\nInspector Raglan wrote down something in his notebook.\\n“Well?” demanded Kent.\\n“Inquiries will be made,” said the inspector. “If you’ve spoken the truth,\\nyou won’t have anything to complain about. What were you doing at Fernly\\nPark anyway?”\\n“Went there to meet someone.”\\n“Who?”\\n“That’s none of your business.”\\n“You’d better keep a civil tongue in your head, my man,” the\\nsuperintendent warned him.\\n“To hell with a civil tongue. I went there on my own business, and that’s\\nall there is to it. If I was clear away before the murder was done, that’s all\\nthat concerns the cops.”\\n“Your name, it is Charles Kent,” said Poirot. “Where were you born?”\\nThe man stared at him, then he grinned.\\n“I’m a full-blown Britisher all right,” he said.\\n“Yes,” said Poirot meditatively. “I think you are. I fancy you were born\\nin Kent.”\\nThe man stared.\\n“Why’s that? Because of my name? What’s that to do with it? Is a man\\nwhose name is Kent bound to be born in that particular county?”\\n“Under certain circumstances, I can imagine he might be,” said Poirot\\nvery deliberately. “Under certain circumstances, you comprehend.”\\nThere was so much meaning in his voice as to surprise the two police\\nofficers. As for Charles Kent, he flushed a brick red, and for a moment I\\nthought he was going to spring at Poirot. He thought better of it, however,\\nand turned away with a kind of laugh.\\nPoirot nodded as though satisfied, and made his way out through the\\ndoor. He was joined presently by the two officers.\\n“We’ll verify that statement,” remarked Raglan. “I don’t think he’s\\nlying, though. But he’s got to come clean with a statement as to what he\\nwas doing at Fernly. It looks to me as though we’d got our blackmailer all\\nright. On the other hand, granted his story’s correct, he couldn’t have had\\nanything to do with the actual murder. He’d got ten pounds on him when he\\nwas arrested—rather a large sum. I fancy that forty pounds went to him—\\nthe numbers of the notes didn’t correspond, but of course he’d have\\nchanged them first thing. Mr. Ackroyd must have given him the money, and\\nhe made off with it as fast as possible. What was that about Kent being his\\nbirthplace? What’s that got to do with it?”\\n“Nothing whatever,” said Poirot mildly. “A little idea of mine, that was\\nall. Me, I am famous for my little ideas.”\\n“Are you really?” said Raglan, studying him with a puzzled expression.\\nThe superintendent went into a roar of laughter.\\n“Many’s the time I’ve heard Inspector Japp say that. M. Poirot and his\\nlittle ideas! Too fanciful for me, he’d say, but always something in them.”\\n“You mock yourself at me,” said Poirot, smiling; “but never mind. The\\nold ones they laugh last sometimes, when the young, clever ones do not\\nlaugh at all.”\\nAnd nodding his head at them in a sage manner he walked out into the\\nstreet.\\nHe and I lunched together at an hotel. I know now that the whole thing\\nlay clearly unravelled before him. He had got the last thread he needed to\\nlead him to the truth.\\nBut at the time I had no suspicion of the fact. I overestimated his\\ngeneral self-confidence, and I took it for granted that the things which\\npuzzled me must be equally puzzling to him.\\nMy chief puzzle was what the man Charles Kent could have been doing\\nat Fernly. Again and again I put the question to myself and could get no\\nsatisfactory reply. At last I ventured a tentative query to Poirot. His reply\\nwas immediate.\\n“Mon ami, I do not think, I know.”\\n“Really?” I said incredulously.\\n“Yes, indeed. I suppose now that to you it would not make sense if I\\nsaid that he went to Fernly that night because he was born in Kent?”\\nI stared at him.\\n“It certainly doesn’t seem to make sense to me,” I said drily.\\n“Ah!” said Poirot pityingly. “Well, no matter. I have still my little idea.”\\nNineteen\\nFLORA ACKROYD\\nAs I was returning from my round the following morning, I was hailed by\\nInspector Raglan. I pulled up, and the inspector mounted on the step.\\n“Good morning, Dr. Sheppard,” he said. “Well, that alibi is all right\\nenough.”\\n“Charles Kent’s?”\\n“Charles Kent’s. The barmaid at the Dog and Whistle, Sally Jones, she\\nremembers him perfectly. Picked out his photograph from among five\\nothers. It was just a quarter to ten when he came into the bar, and the Dog\\nand Whistle is well over a mile from Fernly Park. The girl mentions that he\\nhad a lot of money on him—she saw him take a handful of notes out of his\\npocket. Rather surprised her, it did, seeing the class of fellow he was, with a\\npair of boots clean dropping off him. That’s where that forty pounds went\\nright enough.”\\n“The man still refuses to give an account of his visit to Fernly?”\\n“Obstinate as a mule he is. I had a chat with Hayes at Liverpool over the\\nwire this morning.”\\n“Hercule Poirot says he knows the reason the man went there that\\nnight,” I observed.\\n“Does he?” cried the inspector eagerly.\\n“Yes,” I said maliciously. “He says he went there because he was born\\nin Kent.”\\nI felt a distinct pleasure in passing on my own discomfiture.\\nRaglan stared at me for a moment or two uncomprehendingly. Then a\\ngrin overspread his weaselly countenance and he tapped his forehead\\nsignificantly.\\n“But gone here,” he said. “I’ve thought so for some time. Poor old chap,\\nso that’s why he had to give up and come down here. In the family, very\\nlikely. He’s got a nephew who’s quite off his crumpet.”\\n“Poirot has?” I said, very surprised.\\n“Yes. Hasn’t he ever mentioned him to you? Quite docile, I believe, and\\nall that, but mad as a hatter, poor lad.”\\n“Who told you that?”\\nAgain a grin showed itself on Inspector Raglan’s face.\\n“Your sister, Miss Sheppard, she told me all about it.”\\nReally, Caroline is amazing. She never rests until she knows the last\\ndetails of everybody’s family secrets. Unfortunately, I have never been able\\nto instil into her the decency of keeping them to herself.\\n“Jump in, Inspector,” I said, opening the door of the car. “We’ll go up to\\nThe Larches together, and acquaint our Belgian friend with the latest news.”\\n“Might as well, I suppose. After all, even if he is a bit barmy, it was a\\nuseful tip he gave me about those fingerprints. He’s got a bee in his bonnet\\nabout the man Kent, but who knows—there may be something useful\\nbehind it.”\\nPoirot received us with his usual smiling courtesy.\\nHe listened to the information we had brought him, nodding his head\\nnow and then.\\n“Seems quite O.K., doesn’t it?” said the inspector rather gloomily. “A\\nchap can’t be murdering someone in one place when he’s drinking in the\\nbar in another place a mile away.”\\n“Are you going to release him?”\\n“Don’t see what else we can do. We can’t very well hold him for\\nobtaining money on false pretences. Can’t prove a ruddy thing.”\\nThe inspector tossed a match into the grate in a disgruntled fashion.\\nPoirot retrieved it and put it neatly in a little receptacle designed for the\\npurpose. His action was purely mechanical. I could see that his thoughts\\nwere on something very different.\\n“If I were you,” he said at last, “I should not release the man Charles\\nKent yet.”\\n“What do you mean?”\\nRaglan stared at him.\\n“What I say. I should not release him yet.”\\n“You don’t think he can have had anything to do with the murder, do\\nyou?”\\n“I think probably not—but one cannot be certain yet.”\\n“But haven’t I just told you—?”\\nPoirot raised a hand protestingly.\\n“Mais oui, mais oui. I heard. I am not deaf—or stupid, thank the good\\nGod! But you see, you approach the matter from the wrong—the wrong—\\npremises, is not that the word?”\\nThe inspector stared at him heavily.\\n“I don’t see how you make that out. Look here, we know Mr. Ackroyd\\nwas alive at a quarter to ten. You admit that, don’t you?”\\nPoirot looked at him for a moment, then shook his head with a quick\\nsmile.\\n“I admit nothing that is not—proved!”\\n“Well, we’ve got proof enough of that. We’ve got Miss Flora Ackroyd’s\\nevidence.”\\n“That she said goodnight to her uncle? But me—I do not always believe\\nwhat a young lady tells me—no, not even when she is charming and\\nbeautiful.”\\n“But hang it all, man, Parker saw her coming out of the door.”\\n“No.” Poirot’s voice rang out with sudden sharpness. “That is just what\\nhe did not see. I satisfied myself of that by a little experiment the other day\\n—you remember, doctor? Parker saw her outside the door, with her hand on\\nthe handle. He did not see her come out of the room.”\\n“But—where else could she have been?”\\n“Perhaps on the stairs.”\\n“The stairs?”\\n“That is my little idea—yes.”\\n“But those stairs only lead to Mr. Ackroyd’s bedroom.”\\n“Precisely.”\\nAnd still the inspector stared.\\n“You think she’d been up to her uncle’s bedroom? Well, why not? Why\\nshould she lie about it?”\\n“Ah! that is just the question. It depends on what she was doing there,\\ndoes it not?”\\n“You mean—the money? Hang it all, you don’t suggest that it was Miss\\nAckroyd who took that forty pounds?”\\n“I suggest nothing,” said Poirot. “But I will remind you of this. Life was\\nnot very easy for that mother and daughter. There were bills—there was\\nconstant trouble over small sums of money. Roger Ackroyd was a peculiar\\nman over money matters. The girl might be at her wits’ end for a\\ncomparatively small sum. Figure to yourself then what happens. She has\\ntaken the money, she descends the little staircase. When she is halfway\\ndown she hears the chink of glass from the hall. She has not a doubt of what\\nit is—Parker coming to the study. At all costs she must not be found on the\\nstairs—Parker will not forget it, he will think it odd. If the money is missed,\\nParker is sure to remember having seen her come down those stairs. She has\\njust time to rush down to the study door—with her hand on the handle to\\nshow that she has just come out, when Parker appears in the doorway. She\\nsays the first thing that comes into her head, a repetition of Roger\\nAckroyd’s orders earlier in the evening, and then goes upstairs to her own\\nroom.”\\n“Yes, but later,” persisted the inspector, “she must have realized the\\nvital importance of speaking the truth? Why, the whole case hinges on it!”\\n“Afterwards,” said Poirot drily, “it was a little difficult for\\nMademoiselle Flora. She is told simply that the police are here and that\\nthere has been a robbery. Naturally she jumps to the conclusion that the\\ntheft of the money has been discovered. Her one idea is to stick to her story.\\nWhen she learns that her uncle is dead she is panic-stricken. Young women\\ndo not faint nowadays, monsieur, without considerable provocation. Eh\\nbien! There it is. She is bound to stick to her story, or else confess\\neverything. And a young and pretty girl does not like to admit that she is a\\nthief—especially before those whose esteem she is anxious to retain.”\\nRaglan brought his fist down with a thump on the table.\\n“I’ll not believe it,” he said. “It’s—it’s not credible. And you—you’ve\\nknown this all along?”\\n“The possibility has been in my mind from the first,” admitted Poirot. “I\\nwas always convinced that Mademoiselle Flora was hiding something from\\nus. To satisfy myself, I made the little experiment I told you of. Dr.\\nSheppard accompanied me.”\\n“A test for Parker, you said it was,” I remarked bitterly.\\n“Mon ami,” said Poirot apologetically, “as I told you at the time, one\\nmust say something.”\\nThe inspector rose.\\n“There’s only one thing for it,” he declared. “We must tackle the young\\nlady right away. You’ll come up to Fernly with me, M. Poirot?”\\n“Certainly. Dr. Sheppard will drive us up in his car.”\\nI acquiesced willingly.\\nOn inquiry for Miss Ackroyd, we were shown into the billiard room.\\nFlora and Major Hector Blunt were sitting on the long window seat.\\n“Good morning, Miss Ackroyd,” said the inspector. “Can we have a\\nword or two alone with you?”\\nBlunt got up at once and moved to the door.\\n“What is it?” asked Flora nervously. “Don’t go, Major Blunt. He can\\nstay, can’t he?” she asked, turning to the inspector.\\n“That’s as you like,” said the inspector drily. “There’s a question or two\\nit’s my duty to put to you, miss, but I’d prefer to do so privately, and I dare\\nsay you’d prefer it also.”\\nFlora looked keenly at him. I saw her face grow whiter. Then she turned\\nand spoke to Blunt.\\n“I want you to stay—please—yes, I mean it. Whatever the inspector has\\nto say to me, I’d rather you heard it.”\\nRaglan shrugged his shoulders.\\n“Well, if you will have it so, that’s all there is to it. Now, Miss Ackroyd,\\nM. Poirot here has made a certain suggestion to me. He suggests that you\\nweren’t in the study at all last Friday night, that you never saw Mr. Ackroyd\\nto say goodnight to him, that instead of being in the study you were on the\\nstairs leading down from your uncle’s bedroom when you heard Parker\\ncoming across the hall.”\\nFlora’s gaze shifted to Poirot. He nodded back at her.\\n“Mademoiselle, the other day, when we sat round the table, I implored\\nyou to be frank with me. What one does not tell to Papa Poirot he finds out.\\nIt was that, was it not? See, I will make it easy for you. You took the money,\\ndid you not?”\\n“The money?” said Blunt sharply.\\nThere was a silence which lasted for at least a minute.\\nThen Flora drew herself up and spoke.\\n“M. Poirot is right. I took that money. I stole. I am a thief—yes, a\\ncommon, vulgar little thief. Now you know! I am glad it has come out. It’s\\nbeen a nightmare, these last few days!” She sat down suddenly and buried\\nher face in her hands. She spoke huskily through her fingers. “You don’t\\nknow what my life has been since I came here. Wanting things, scheming\\nfor them, lying, cheating, running up bills, promising to pay—oh! I hate\\nmyself when I think of it all! That’s what brought us together, Ralph and I.\\nWe were both weak! I understood him, and I was sorry—because I’m the\\nsame underneath. We’re not strong enough to stand alone, either of us.\\nWe’re weak, miserable, despicable things.”\\nShe looked at Blunt and suddenly stamped her foot.\\n“Why do you look at me like that—as though you couldn’t believe? I\\nmay be a thief—but at any rate I’m real now. I’m not lying any more. I’m\\nnot pretending to be the kind of girl you like, young and innocent and\\nsimple. I don’t care if you never want to see me again. I hate myself,\\ndespise myself—but you’ve got to believe one thing, if speaking the truth\\nwould have made things better for Ralph, I would have spoken out. But I’ve\\nseen all along that it wouldn’t be better for Ralph—it makes the case\\nagainst him blacker than ever. I was not doing him any harm by sticking to\\nmy lie.”\\n“Ralph,” said Blunt. “I see—always Ralph.”\\n“You don’t understand,” said Flora hopelessly. “You never will.”\\nShe turned to the inspector.\\n“I admit everything; I was at my wits’ end for money. I never saw my\\nuncle that evening after he left the dinner table. As to the money, you can\\ntake what steps you please. Nothing could be worse than it is now!”\\nSuddenly she broke down again, hid her face in her hands, and rushed\\nfrom the room.\\n“Well,” said the inspector in a flat tone, “so that’s that.”\\nHe seemed rather at a loss what to do next.\\nBlunt came forward.\\n“Inspector Raglan,” he said quietly, “that money was given to me by\\nMr. Ackroyd for a special purpose. Miss Ackroyd never touched it. When\\nshe says she did, she is lying with the idea of shielding Captain Paton. The\\ntruth is as I said, and I am prepared to go into the witness-box and swear to\\nit.”\\nHe made a kind of jerky bow, then turning abruptly he left the room.\\nPoirot was after him in a flash. He caught the other up in the hall.\\n“Monsieur—a moment, I beg of you, if you will be so good.”\\n“Well, sir?”\\nBlunt was obviously impatient. He stood frowning down on Poirot.\\n“It is this,” said Poirot rapidly: “I am not deceived by your little fantasy.\\nNo, indeed. It was truly Miss Flora who took the money. All the same it is\\nwell imagined what you say—it pleases me. It is very good what you have\\ndone there. You are a man quick to think and to act.”\\n“I’m not in the least anxious for your opinion, thank you,” said Blunt\\ncoldly.\\nHe made once more as though to pass on, but Poirot, not at all offended,\\nlaid a detaining hand on his arm.\\n“Ah! but you are to listen to me. I have more to say. The other day I\\nspoke of concealments. Very well, all along I have seen what you are\\nconcealing. Mademoiselle Flora, you love her with all your heart. From the\\nfirst moment you saw her, is it not so? Oh! let us not mind saying these\\nthings—why must one in England think it necessary to mention love as\\nthough it were some disgraceful secret? You love Mademoiselle Flora. You\\nseek to conceal that fact from all the world. That is very good—that is as it\\nshould be. But take the advice of Hercule Poirot—do not conceal it from\\nmademoiselle herself.”\\nBlunt had shown several signs of restlessness whilst Poirot was\\nspeaking, but the closing words seemed to rivet his attention.\\n“What d’you mean by that?” he said sharply.\\n“You think that she loves the Capitaine Ralph Paton—but I, Hercule\\nPoirot, tell you that that is not so. Mademoiselle Flora accepted Captain\\nPaton to please her uncle, and because she saw in the marriage a way of\\nescape from her life here which was becoming frankly insupportable to her.\\nShe liked him, and there was much sympathy and understanding between\\nthem. But love—no! It is not Captain Paton Mademoiselle Flora loves.”\\n“What the devil do you mean?” asked Blunt.\\nI saw the dark flush under his tan.\\n“You have been blind, monsieur. Blind! She is loyal, the little one.\\nRalph Paton is under a cloud, she is bound in honour to stick by him.”\\nI felt it was time I put in a word to help on the good work.\\n“My sister told me the other night,” I said encouragingly, “that Flora\\nhad never cared a penny piece for Ralph Paton, and never would. My sister\\nis always right about these things.”\\nBlunt ignored my well-meant offers. He spoke to Poirot.\\n“D’you really think—” he began, and stopped.\\nHe is one of those inarticulate men who find it hard to put things into\\nwords.\\nPoirot knows no such disability.\\n“If you doubt me, ask her yourself, monsieur. But perhaps you no\\nlonger care to—the affair of the money—”\\nBlunt gave a sound like an angry laugh.\\n“Think I’d hold that against her? Roger was always a queer chap about\\nmoney. She got in a mess and didn’t dare tell him. Poor kid. Poor lonely\\nkid.”\\nPoirot looked thoughtfully at the side door.\\n“Mademoiselle Flora went into the garden, I think,” he murmured.\\n“I’ve been every kind of a fool,” said Blunt abruptly. “Rum\\nconversation we’ve been having. Like one of those Danish plays. But\\nyou’re a sound fellow, M. Poirot. Thank you.”\\nHe took Poirot’s hand and gave it a grip which caused the other to\\nwince in anguish. Then he strode to the side door and passed out into the\\ngarden.\\n“Not every kind of a fool,” murmured Poirot, tenderly nursing the\\ninjured member. “Only one kind—the fool in love.”\\nTwenty\\nMISS RUSSELL\\nInspector Raglan had received a bad jolt. He was not deceived by Blunt’s\\nvaliant lie any more than we had been. Our way back to the village was\\npunctuated by his complaints.\\n“This alters everything, this does. I don’t know whether you’ve realized\\nit, Monsieur Poirot?”\\n“I think so, yes, I think so,” said Poirot. “You see, me, I have been\\nfamiliar with the idea for some time.”\\nInspector Raglan, who had only had the idea presented to him a short\\nhalf hour ago, looked at Poirot unhappily, and went on with his discoveries.\\n“Those alibis now. Worthless! Absolutely worthless. Got to start again.\\nFind out what everyone was doing from nine-thirty onwards. Nine-thirty—\\nthat’s the time we’ve got to hang on to. You were quite right about the man\\nKent—we don’t release him yet awhile. Let me see now—nine-forty-five at\\nthe Dog and Whistle. He might have got there in a quarter of an hour if he\\nran. It’s just possible that it was his voice Mr. Raymond heard talking to Mr.\\nAckroyd—asking for money which Mr. Ackroyd refused. But one thing’s\\nclear—it wasn’t he who sent the telephone message. The station is half a\\nmile in the other direction—over a mile and a half from the Dog and\\nWhistle, and he was at the Dog and Whistle until about ten minutes past\\nten. Dang that telephone call! We always come up against it.”\\n“We do indeed,” agreed Poirot. “It is curious.”\\n“It’s just possible that if Captain Paton climbed into his uncle’s room\\nand found him there murdered, he may have sent it. Got the wind up,\\nthought he’d be accused, and cleared out. That’s possible, isn’t it?”\\n“Why should he have telephoned?”\\n“May have had doubts if the old man was really dead. Thought he’d get\\nthe doctor up there as soon as possible, but didn’t want to give himself\\naway. Yes, I say now, how’s that for a theory? Something in that, I should\\nsay.”\\nThe inspector swelled his chest out importantly. He was so plainly\\ndelighted with himself that any words of ours would have been quite\\nsuperfluous.\\nWe arrived back at my house at this minute, and I hurried in to my\\nsurgery patients, who had all been waiting a considerable time, leaving\\nPoirot to walk to the police station with the inspector.\\nHaving dismissed the last patient, I strolled into the little room at the\\nback of the house which I call my workshop—I am rather proud of the\\nhome-made wireless set I turned out. Caroline hates my workroom. I have\\nkept my tools there, and Annie is not allowed to wreak havoc with a\\ndustpan and brush. I was just adjusting the interior of an alarm clock which\\nhad been denounced as wholly unreliable by the household, when the door\\nopened and Caroline put her head in.\\n“Oh! there you are, James,” she said, with deep disapproval. “M. Poirot\\nwants to see you.”\\n“Well,” I said, rather irritably, for her sudden entrance had startled me\\nand I had let go of a piece of delicate mechanism. “If he wants to see me, he\\ncan come in here.”\\n“In here?” said Caroline.\\n“That’s what I said—in here.”\\nCaroline gave a sniff of disapproval and retired. She returned in a\\nmoment or two, ushering in Poirot, and then retired again, shutting the door\\nwith a bang.\\n“Aha! my friend,” said Poirot, coming forward and rubbing his hands.\\n“You have not got rid of me so easily, you see!”\\n“Finished with the inspector?” I asked.\\n“For the moment, yes. And you, you have seen all the patients?”\\n“Yes.”\\nPoirot sat down and looked at me, tilting his egg-shaped head on one\\nside, with the air of one who savours a very delicious joke.\\n“You are in error,” he said at last. “You have still one patient to see.”\\n“Not you?” I exclaimed in surprise.\\n“Ah, not me, bien entendu. Me, I have the health magnificent. No, to\\ntell you the truth, it is a little complot of mine. There is someone I wish to\\nsee, you understand—and at the same time it is not necessary that the whole\\nvillage should intrigue itself about the matter—which is what would happen\\nif the lady were seen to come to my house—for it is a lady. But to you she\\nhas already come as a patient before.”\\n“Miss Russell!” I exclaimed.\\n“Précisément. I wish much to speak with her, so I send her the little note\\nand make the appointment in your surgery. You are not annoyed with me?”\\n“On the contrary,” I said. “That is, presuming I am allowed to be\\npresent at the interview?”\\n“But naturally! In your own surgery!”\\n“You know,” I said, throwing down the pincers I was holding, “it’s\\nextraordinarily intriguing, the whole thing. Every new development that\\narises is like the shake you give to a kaleidoscope—the thing changes\\nentirely in aspect. Now, why are you so anxious to see Miss Russell?”\\nPoirot raised his eyebrows.\\n“Surely it is obvious?” he murmured.\\n“There you go again,” I grumbled. “According to you everything is\\nobvious. But you leave me walking about in a fog.”\\nPoirot shook his head genially to me.\\n“You mock yourself at me. Take the matter of Mademoiselle Flora. The\\ninspector was surprised—but you—you were not.”\\n“I never dreamed of her being the thief,” I expostulated.\\n“That—perhaps no. But I was watching your face and you were not—\\nlike Inspector Raglan—startled and incredulous.”\\nI thought for a minute or two.\\n“Perhpas you are right,” I said at last. “All along I’ve felt that Flora was\\nkeeping back something—so the truth, when it came, was subconsciously\\nexpected. It upset Inspector Raglan very much indeed, poor man.”\\n“Ah! pour ça oui! The poor man must rearrange all his ideas. I profited\\nby his state of mental chaos to induce him to grant me a little favour.”\\n“What was that?”\\nPoirot took a sheet of notepaper from his pocket. Some words were\\nwritten on it, and he read them aloud.\\n“The police have, for some days, been seeking for Captain Ralph Paton,\\nthe nephew of Mr. Ackroyd of Fernly Park, whose death occurred under\\nsuch tragic circumstances last Friday. Captain Paton has been found at\\nLiverpool, where he was on the point of embarking for America.”\\nHe folded up the piece of paper again.\\n“That, my friend, will be in the newspapers tomorrow morning.”\\nI stared at him, dumbfounded.\\n“But—but it isn’t true! He’s not at Liverpool!”\\nPoirot beamed on me.\\n“You have the intelligence so quick! No, he has not been found at\\nLiverpool. Inspector Raglan was very loath to let me send this paragraph to\\nthe press, especially as I could not take him into my confidence. But I\\nassured him most solemnly that very interesting results would follow its\\nappearance in print, so he gave in, after stipulating that he was, on no\\naccount, to bear the responsibility.”\\nI stared at Poirot. He smiled back at me.\\n“It beats me,” I said at last, “what you expect to get out of that.”\\n“You should employ your little grey cells,” said Poirot gravely.\\nHe rose and came across to the bench.\\n“It is that you have really the love of the machinery,” he said, after\\ninspecting the débris of my labours.\\nEvery man has his hobby. I immediately drew Poirot’s attention to my\\nhome-made wireless. Finding him sympathetic, I showed him one or two\\nlittle inventions of my own—trifling things, but useful in the house.\\n“Decidedly,” said Poirot, “you should be an inventor by trade, not a\\ndoctor. But I hear the bell—that is your patient. Let us go into the surgery.”\\nOnce before I had been struck by the remnants of beauty in the\\nhousekeeper’s face. This morning I was struck anew. Very simply dressed\\nin black, tall, upright and independent as ever, with her big dark eyes and an\\nunwonted flush of colour in her usually pale cheeks, I realized that as a girl\\nshe must have been startlingly handsome.\\n“Good morning, mademoiselle,” said Poirot. “Will you be seated? Dr.\\nSheppard is so kind as to permit me the use of his surgery for a little\\nconversation I am anxious to have with you.”\\nMiss Russell sat down with her usual composure. If she felt any inward\\nagitation, it did not display itself in any outward manifestation.\\n“It seems a queer way of doing things, if you’ll allow me to say so,” she\\nremarked.\\n“Miss Russell—I have news to give you.”\\n“Indeed!”\\n“Charles Kent has been arrested at Liverpool.”\\nNot a muscle of her face moved. She merely opened her eyes a trifle\\nwider, and asked, with a tinge of defiance:\\n“Well, what of it?”\\nBut at that moment it came to me—the resemblance that had haunted\\nme all along, something familiar in the defiance of Charles Kent’s manner.\\nThe two voices, one rough and coarse, the other painfully ladylike—were\\nstrangely the same in timbre. It was of Miss Russell that I had been\\nreminded that night outside the gates of Fernly Park.\\nI looked at Poirot, full of my discovery, and he gave me an\\nimperceptible nod.\\nIn answer to Miss Russell’s question, he threw out his hands in a\\nthoroughly French gesture.\\n“I thought you might be interested, that is all,” he said mildly.\\n“Well, I’m not particularly,” said Miss Russell. “Who is this Charles\\nKent anyway?”\\n“He is a man, mademoiselle, who was at Fernly on the night of the\\nmurder.”\\n“Really?”\\n“Fortunately for him, he has an alibi. At a quarter to ten he was at a\\npublic-house a mile from here.”\\n“Lucky for him,” commented Miss Russell.\\n“But we still do not know what he was doing at Fernly—who it was he\\nwent to meet, for instance.”\\n“I’m afraid I can’t help you at all,” said the housekeeper politely.\\n“Nothing came to my ears. If that is all—”\\nShe made a tentative movement as though to rise. Poirot stopped her.\\n“It is not quite all,” he said smoothly. “This morning fresh\\ndevelopments have arisen. It seems now that Mr. Ackroyd was murdered,\\nnot at a quarter to ten, but before. Between ten minutes to nine, when Dr.\\nSheppard left, and a quarter to ten.”\\nI saw the colour drain from the housekeeper’s face, leaving it dead\\nwhite. She leaned forward, her figure swaying.\\n“But Miss Ackroyd said—Miss Ackroyd said—”\\n“Miss Ackroyd has admitted that she was lying. She was never in the\\nstudy at all that evening.”\\n“Then—”\\n“Then it would seem that in this Charles Kent we have the man we are\\nlooking for. He came to Fernly, can give no account of what he was doing\\nthere—”\\n“I can tell you what he was doing there. He never touched a hair of old\\nAckroyd’s head—he never went near the study. He didn’t do it, I tell you.”\\nShe was leaning forward. That iron self-control was broken through at\\nlast. Terror and desperation was in her face.\\n“M. Poirot! M. Poirot! Oh, do believe me.”\\nPoirot got up and came to her. He patted her reassuringly on the\\nshoulder.\\n“But yes—but yes, I will believe. I had to make you speak, you know.”\\nFor an instant suspicion flared up in her.\\n“Is what you said true?”\\n“That Charles Kent is suspected of the crime? Yes, that is true. You\\nalone can save him, by telling the reason for his being at Fernly.”\\n“He came to see me.” She spoke in a low, hurried voice. “I went out to\\nmeet him—”\\n“In the summerhouse, yes, I know.”\\n“How do you know?”\\n“Mademoiselle, it is the business of Hercule Poirot to know things. I\\nknow that you went out earlier in the evening, that you left a message in the\\nsummerhouse to say what time you would be there.”\\n“Yes, I did. I had heard from him—saying he was coming. I dared not\\nlet him come to the house. I wrote to the address he gave me and said I\\nwould meet him in the summerhouse, and described it to him so that he\\nwould be able to find it. Then I was afraid he might not wait there patiently,\\nand I ran out and left a piece of paper to say I would be there about ten\\nminutes past nine. I didn’t want the servants to see me, so I slipped out\\nthrough the drawing room window. As I came back, I met Dr. Sheppard,\\nand I fancied that he would think it queer. I was out of breath, for I had been\\nrunning. I had no idea that he was expected to dinner that night.”\\nShe paused.\\n“Go on,” said Poirot. “You went out to meet him at ten minutes past\\nnine. What did you say to each other?”\\n“It’s difficult. You see—”\\n“Mademoiselle,” said Poirot, interrupting her, “in this matter I must\\nhave the whole truth. What you tell us need never go beyond these four\\nwalls. Dr. Sheppard will be discreet, and so shall I. See, I will help you.\\nThis Charles Kent, he is your son, is he not?”\\nShe nodded. The colour had flamed into her cheeks.\\n“No one has ever known. It was long ago—long ago—down in Kent. I\\nwas not married….”\\n“So you took the name of the county as a surname for him. I\\nunderstand.”\\n“I got work. I managed to pay for his board and lodging. I never told\\nhim that I was his mother. But he turned out badly, he drank, then took to\\ndrugs. I managed to pay his passage out to Canada. I didn’t hear of him for\\na year or two. Then, somehow or other, he found out that I was his mother.\\nHe wrote asking me for money. Finally, I heard from him back in this\\ncountry again. He was coming to see me at Fernly, he said. I dared not let\\nhim come to the house. I have always been considered so—so very\\nrespectable. If anyone got an inkling—it would have been all up with my\\npost as housekeeper. So I wrote to him in the way I have just told you.”\\n“And in the morning you came to see Dr. Sheppard?”\\n“Yes. I wondered if something could be done. He was not a bad boy—\\nbefore he took to drugs.”\\n“I see,” said Poirot. “Now let us go on with the story. He came that\\nnight to the summerhouse?”\\n“Yes, he was waiting for me when I got there. He was very rough and\\nabusive. I had brought with me all the money I had, and I gave it to him. We\\ntalked a little, and then he went away.”\\n“What time was that?”\\n“It must have been between twenty and twenty-five minutes past nine. It\\nwas not yet half past when I got back to the house.”\\n“Which way did he go?”\\n“Straight out the same way he came, by the path that joined the drive\\njust inside the lodge gates.”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“And you, what did you do?”\\n“I went back to the house. Major Blunt was walking up and down the\\nterrace smoking, so I made a detour to get round to the side door. It was just\\nthen on half past nine, as I tell you.”\\nPoirot nodded again. He made a note or two in a microscopic\\npocketbook.\\n“I think that is all,” he said thoughtfully.\\n“Ought I—?” she hesitated. “Ought I to tell all this to Inspector\\nRaglan?”\\n“It may come to that. But let us not be in a hurry. Let us proceed slowly,\\nwith due order and method. Charles Kent is not yet formally charged with\\nmurder. Circumstances may arise which will render your story\\nunnecessary.”\\nMiss Russell rose.\\n“Thank you very much, M. Poirot,” she said. “You have been very kind\\n—very kind indeed. You—you do believe me, don’t you? That Charles had\\nnothing to do with this wicked murder!”\\n“There seems no doubt that the man who was talking to Mr. Ackroyd in\\nthe library at nine-thirty could not possibly have been your son. Be of good\\ncourage, mademoiselle. All will yet be well.”\\nMiss Russell departed. Poirot and I were left together.\\n“So that’s that,” I said. “Every time we come back to Ralph Paton. How\\ndid you manage to spot Miss Russell as the person Charles Kent came to\\nmeet? Did you notice the resemblance?”\\n“I had connected her with the unknown man long before we actually\\ncame face to face with him. As soon as we found that quill. The quill\\nsuggested dope, and I remembered your account of Miss Russell’s visit to\\nyou. Then I found the article on cocaine in that morning’s paper. It all\\nseemed very clear. She had heard from someone that morning—someone\\naddicted to drugs, she read the article in the paper, and she came to ask you\\na few tentative questions. She mentioned cocaine, since the article in\\nquestion was on cocaine. Then, when you seemed too interested, she\\nswitched hurriedly to the subject of detective stories and untraceable\\npoisons. I suspected a son or a brother, or some other undesirable male\\nrelation. Ah! but I must go. It is the time of the lunch.”\\n“Stay and lunch with us,” I suggested.\\nPoirot shook his head. A faint twinkle came into his eye.\\n“Not again today. I should not like to force Mademoiselle Caroline to\\nadopt a vegetarian diet two days in succession.”\\nIt occurred to me that there was not much which escaped Hercule\\nPoirot.\\nTwenty-one\\nTHE PARAGRAPH IN THE PAPER\\nCaroline, of course, had not failed to see Miss Russell come to the surgery\\ndoor. I had anticipated this, and had ready an elaborate account of the lady’s\\nbad knee. But Caroline was not in a cross-questioning mood. Her point of\\nview was that she knew what Miss Russell had really come for and that I\\ndidn’t.\\n“Pumping you, James,” said Caroline. “Pumping you in the most\\nshameless manner, I’ve no doubt. It’s no good interrupting. I dare say you\\nhadn’t the least idea she was doing it even. Men are so simple. She knows\\nthat you are in M. Poirot’s confidence, and she wants to find out things. Do\\nyou know what I think, James?”\\n“I couldn’t begin to imagine. You think so many extraordinary things.”\\n“It’s no good being sarcastic. I think Miss Russell knows more about\\nMr. Ackroyd’s death than she is prepared to admit.”\\nCaroline leaned back triumphantly in her chair.\\n“Do you really think so?” I said absently.\\n“You are very dull today, James. No animation about you. It’s that liver\\nof yours.”\\nOur conversation then dealt with purely personal matters.\\nThe paragraph inspired by Poirot duly appeared in our daily paper the\\nnext morning. I was in the dark as to its purpose, but its effect on Caroline\\nwas immense.\\nShe began by stating, most untruly, that she had said as much all along.\\nI raised my eyebrows, but did not argue. Caroline, however, must have felt\\na prick of conscience, for she went on:\\n“I mayn’t have actually mentioned Liverpool, but I knew he’d try to get\\naway to America. That’s what Crippen did.”\\n“Without much success,” I reminded her.\\n“Poor boy, and so they’ve caught him. I consider, James, that it’s your\\nduty to see that he isn’t hung.”\\n“What do you expect me to do?”\\n“Why, you’re a medical man, aren’t you? You’ve known him from a\\nboy upwards. Not mentally responsible. That’s the line to take, clearly. I\\nread only the other day that they’re very happy in Broadmoor—it’s quite\\nlike a high-class club.”\\nBut Caroline’s words had reminded me of something.\\n“I never knew that Poirot had an imbecile nephew?” I said curiously.\\n“Didn’t you? Oh, he told me all about it. Poor lad. It’s a great grief to all\\nthe family. They’ve kept him at home so far, but it’s getting to such a pitch\\nthat they’re afraid he’ll have to go into some kind of institution.”\\n“I suppose you know pretty well everything there is to know about\\nPoirot’s family by this time,” I said, exasperated.\\n“Pretty well,” said Caroline complacently. “It’s a great relief to people\\nto be able to tell all their troubles to someone.”\\n“It might be,” I said, “if they were ever allowed to do so spontaneously.\\nWhether they enjoy having confidences screwed out of them by force is\\nanother matter.”\\nCaroline merely looked at me with an air of a Christian martyr enjoying\\nmartyrdom.\\n“You are so self-contained, James,” she said. “You hate speaking out, or\\nparting with any information yourself, and you think everybody else must\\nbe just like you. I should hope that I never screw confidences out of\\nanybody. For instance, if M. Poirot comes in this afternoon, as he said he\\nmight do, I shall not dream of asking him who it was arrived at his house\\nearly this morning.”\\n“Early this morning?” I queried.\\n“Very early,” said Caroline. “Before the milk came. I just happened to\\nbe looking out of the window—the blind was flapping. It was a man. He\\ncame in a closed car, and he was all muffled up. I couldn’t get a glimpse of\\nhis face. But I will tell you my idea, and you’ll see that I’m right.”\\n“What’s your idea?”\\nCaroline dropped her voice mysteriously.\\n“A Home Office expert,” she breathed.\\n“A Home Office expert,” I said, amazed. “My dear Caroline!”\\n“Mark my words, James, you’ll see that I’m right. That Russell woman\\nwas here that morning after your poisons. Roger Ackroyd might easily have\\nbeen poisoned in his food that night.”\\nI laughed out loud.\\n“Nonsense,” I cried. “He was stabbed in the neck. You know that as\\nwell as I do.”\\n“After death, James,” said Caroline; “to make a false clue.”\\n“My good woman,” I said, “I examined the body, and I know what I’m\\ntalking about. That wound wasn’t inflicted after death—it was the cause of\\ndeath, and you need make no mistake about it.”\\nCaroline merely continued to look omniscient, which so annoyed me\\nthat I went on:\\n“Perhaps you will tell me, Caroline, if I have a medical degree or if I\\nhave not?”\\n“You have the medical degree, I dare say, James—at least, I mean I\\nknow you have. But you’ve no imagination whatever.”\\n“Having endowed you with a treble portion, there was none left over for\\nme,” I said drily.\\nI was amused to see Caroline’s manoeuvres that afternoon when Poirot\\nduly arrived. My sister, without asking a direct question, skirted the subject\\nof the mysterious guest in every way imaginable. By the twinkle in Poirot’s\\neyes, I saw that he realized her object. He remained blandly impervious,\\nand blocked her bowling so successfully that she herself was at a loss how\\nto proceed.\\nHaving, I suspect, enjoyed the little game, he rose to his feet and\\nsuggested a walk.\\n“It is that I need to reduce the figure a little,” he explained. “You will\\ncome with me, doctor? And perhaps later, Miss Caroline will give us some\\ntea.”\\n“Delighted,” said Caroline. “Won’t your—er—guest come in also?”\\n“You are too kind,” said Poirot. “But no, my friend reposes himself.\\nSoon you must make his acquaintance.”\\n“Quite an old friend of yours, so somebody told me,” said Caroline,\\nmaking one last valiant effort.\\n“Did they?” murmured Poirot. “Well, we must start.”\\nOur tramp took us in the direction of Fernly. I had guessed beforehand\\nthat it might do so. I was beginning to understand Poirot’s methods. Every\\nlittle irrelevancy had a bearing upon the whole.\\n“I have a commission for you, my friend,” he said at last. “Tonight, at\\nmy house. I desire to have a little conference. You will attend, will you\\nnot?”\\n“Certainly,” I said.\\n“Good. I need also those in the house—that is to say: Mrs. Ackroyd,\\nMademoiselle Flora, Major Blunt, Mr. Raymond. I want you to be my\\nambassador. This little reunion is fixed for nine o’clock. You will ask them\\n—yes?”\\n“With pleasure; but why not ask them yourself?”\\n“Because they will then put the questions: Why? What for? They will\\ndemand what my idea is. And, as you know, my friend, I much dislike to\\nhave to explain my little ideas until the time comes.”\\nI smiled a little.\\n“My friend Hastings, he of whom I told you, used to say of me that I\\nwas the human oyster. But he was unjust. Of facts, I keep nothing to myself.\\nBut to everyone his own interpretation of them.”\\n“When do you want me to do this?”\\n“Now, if you will. We are close to the house.”\\n“Aren’t you coming in?”\\n“No, me, I will promenade myself in the grounds. I will rejoin you by\\nthe lodge gates in a quarter of an hour’s time.”\\nI nodded, and set off on my task. The only member of the family at\\nhome proved to be Mrs. Ackroyd, who was sipping an early cup of tea. She\\nreceived me very graciously.\\n“So grateful to you, doctor,” she murmured, “for clearing up that little\\nmatter with M. Poirot. But life is one trouble after another. You have heard\\nabout Flora, of course?”\\n“What exactly?” I asked cautiously.\\n“This new engagement. Flora and Hector Blunt. Of course not such a\\ngood match as Ralph would have been. But after all, happiness comes first.\\nWhat dear Flora needs is an older man—someone steady and reliable, and\\nthen Hector is really a very distinguished man in his way. You saw the news\\nof Ralph’s arrest in the paper this morning?”\\n“Yes,” I said, “I did.”\\n“Horrible.” Mrs. Ackroyd closed her eyes and shuddered. “Geoffrey\\nRaymond was in a terrible way. Rang up Liverpool. But they wouldn’t tell\\nhim anything at the police station there. In fact, they said they hadn’t\\narrested Ralph at all. Mr. Raymond insists that it’s all a mistake—a—what\\ndo they call it?—canard of the newspaper’s. I’ve forbidden it to be\\nmentioned before the servants. Such a terrible disgrace. Fancy if Flora had\\nactually been married to him.”\\nMrs. Ackroyd shut her eyes in anguish. I began to wonder how soon I\\nshould be able to deliver Poirot’s invitation.\\nBefore I had time to speak, Mrs. Ackroyd was off again.\\n“You were here yesterday, weren’t you, with that dreadful Inspector\\nRaglan? Brute of a man—he terrified Flora into saying she took that money\\nfrom poor Roger’s room. And the matter was so simple, really. The dear\\nchild wanted to borrow a few pounds, didn’t like to disturb her uncle since\\nhe’d given strict orders against it. But knowing where he kept his notes she\\nwent there and took what she needed.”\\n“Is that Flora’s account of the matter?” I asked.\\n“My dear doctor, you know what girls are nowadays. So easily acted on\\nby suggestion. You, of course, know all about hypnosis and that sort of\\nthing. The inspector shouts at her, says the word ‘steal’ over and over again,\\nuntil the poor child gets an inhibition—or is it a complex?—I always mix\\nup those two words—and actually thinks herself that she has stolen the\\nmoney. I saw at once how it was. But I can’t be too thankful for the whole\\nmisunderstanding in one way—it seems to have brought those two together\\n—Hector and Flora, I mean. And I assure you that I have been very much\\nworried about Flora in the past: why, at one time I actually thought there\\nwas going to be some kind of understanding between her and young\\nRaymond. Just think of it!” Mrs. Ackroyd’s voice rose in shrill horror. “A\\nprivate secretary—with practically no means of his own.”\\n“It would have been a severe blow to you,” I said. “Now, Mrs. Ackroyd,\\nI’ve got a message for you from M. Hercule Poirot.”\\n“For me?”\\nMrs. Ackroyd looked quite alarmed.\\nI hastened to reassure her, and I explained what Poirot wanted.\\n“Certainly,” said Mrs. Ackroyd rather doubtfully. “I suppose we must\\ncome if M. Poirot says so. But what is it all about? I like to know\\nbeforehand.”\\nI assured the lady truthfully that I myself did not know any more than\\nshe did.\\n“Very well,” said Mrs. Ackroyd at last, rather grudgingly, “I will tell the\\nothers, and we will be there at nine o’clock.”\\nThereupon I took my leave, and joined Poirot at the agreed meetingplace.\\n“I’ve been longer than a quarter of an hour, I’m afraid,” I remarked.\\n“But once that good lady starts talking it’s a matter of the utmost difficulty\\nto get a word in edgeways.”\\n“It is of no matter,” said Poirot. “Me, I have been well amused. This\\npark is magnificent.”\\nWe set off homewards. When we arrived, to our great surprise Caroline,\\nwho had evidently been watching for us, herself opened the door.\\nShe put her finger to her lips. Her face was full of importance and\\nexcitement.\\n“Ursula Bourne,” she said, “the parlourmaid from Fernly. She’s here!\\nI’ve put her in the dining room. She’s in a terrible way, poor thing. Says she\\nmust see M. Poirot at once. I’ve done all I could. Taken her a cup of hot tea.\\nIt really goes to one’s heart to see anyone in such a state.”\\n“In the dining room?” asked Poirot.\\n“This way,” I said, and flung open the door.\\nUrsula Bourne was sitting by the table. Her arms were spread out in\\nfront of her, and she had evidently just lifted her head from where it had\\nbeen buried. Her eyes were red with weeping.\\n“Ursula Bourne,” I murmured.\\nBut Poirot went past me with outstretched hands.\\n“No,” he said, “that is not quite right, I think. It is not Ursula Bourne, is\\nit, my child—but Ursula Paton? Mrs. Ralph Paton.”\\nTwenty-two\\nURSULA’S STORY\\nFor a moment or two the girl looked mutely at Poirot. Then, her reserve\\nbreaking down completely, she nodded her head once, and burst into an\\noutburst of sobs.\\nCaroline pushed past me, and putting her arm round the girl, patted her\\non the shoulder.\\n“There, there, my dear,” she said soothingly, “it will be all right. You’ll\\nsee—everything will be all right.”\\nBuried under curiosity and scandal-mongering there is a lot of kindness\\nin Caroline. For the moment, even the interest of Poirot’s revelation was\\nlost in the sight of the girl’s distress.\\nPresently Ursula sat up and wiped her eyes.\\n“This is very weak and silly of me,” she said.\\n“No, no, my child,” said Poirot kindly. “We can all realize the strain of\\nthis last week.”\\n“It must have been a terrible ordeal,” I said.\\n“And then to find that you knew,” continued Ursula. “How did you\\nknow? Was it Ralph who told you?”\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n“You know what brought me to you tonight,” went on the girl. “This—”\\nShe held out a crumpled piece of newspaper, and I recognized the\\nparagraph that Poirot had had inserted.\\n“It says that Ralph has been arrested. So everything is useless. I need\\nnot pretend any longer.”\\n“Newspaper paragraphs are not always true, mademoiselle,” murmured\\nPoirot, having the grace to look ashamed of himself. “All the same, I think\\nyou will do well to make a clean breast of things. The truth is what we need\\nnow.”\\nThe girl hesitated, looking at him doubtfully.\\n“You do not trust me,” said Poirot gently. “Yet all the same you came\\nhere to find me, did you not? Why was that?”\\n“Because I don’t believe that Ralph did it,” said the girl in a very low\\nvoice. “And I think that you are clever, and will find out the truth. And also\\n—”\\n“Yes?”\\n“I think you are kind.”\\nPoirot nodded his head several times.\\n“It is very good that—yes, it is very good. Listen, I do in verity believe\\nthat this husband of yours is innocent—but the affair marches badly. If I am\\nto save him, I must know all there is to know—even if it should seem to\\nmake the case against him blacker than before.”\\n“How well you understand,” said Ursula.\\n“So you will tell me the whole story, will you not? From the\\nbeginning.”\\n“You’re not going to send me away, I hope,” said Caroline, settling\\nherself comfortably in an armchair. “What I want to know,” she continued,\\n“is why this child was masquerading as a parlourmaid?”\\n“Masquerading?” I queried.\\n“That’s what I said. Why did you do it, child? For a wager?”\\n“For a living,” said Ursula drily.\\nAnd encouraged, she began the story which I reproduce here in my own\\nwords.\\nUrsula Bourne, it seemed, was one of a family of seven—impoverished\\nIrish gentlefolk. On the death of her father, most of the girls were cast out\\ninto the world to earn their own living. Ursula’s eldest sister was married to\\nCaptain Folliott. It was she whom I had seen that Sunday, and the cause of\\nher embarrassment was clear enough now. Determined to earn her living\\nand not attracted to the idea of being a nursery governess—the one\\nprofession open to an untrained girl—Ursula preferred the job of\\nparlourmaid. She scorned to label herself a “lady parlourmaid.” She would\\nbe the real thing, her reference being supplied by her sister. At Fernly,\\ndespite an aloofness which, as has been seen, caused some comment, she\\nwas a success at her job—quick, competent and thorough.\\n“I enjoyed the work,” she explained. “And I had plenty of time to\\nmyself.”\\nAnd then came her meeting with Ralph Paton, and the love affair which\\nculminated in a secret marriage. Ralph had persuaded her into that,\\nsomewhat against her will. He had declared that his stepfather would not\\nhear of his marrying a penniless girl. Better to be married secretly, and\\nbreak the news to him at some later and more favourable minute.\\nAnd so the deed was done, and Ursula Bourne became Ursula Paton.\\nRalph had declared that he meant to pay off his debts, find a job, and then,\\nwhen he was in a position to support her, and independent of his adopted\\nfather, they would break the news to him.\\nBut to people like Ralph Paton, turning over a new leaf is easier in\\ntheory than in practice. He hoped that his stepfather, whilst still in\\nignorance of the marriage, might be persuaded to pay his debts and put him\\non his feet again. But the revelation of the amount of Ralph’s liabilities\\nmerely enraged Roger Ackroyd, and he refused to do anything at all. Some\\nmonths passed, and then Ralph was bidden once more to Fernly. Roger\\nAckroyd did not beat about the bush. It was the desire of his heart that\\nRalph should marry Flora, and he put the matter plainly before the young\\nman.\\nAnd here it was that the innate weakness of Ralph Paton showed itself.\\nAs always, he grasped at the easy, the immediate solution. As far as I could\\nmake out, neither Flora nor Ralph made any pretence of love. It was, on\\nboth sides, a business arrangement. Roger Ackroyd dictated his wishes—\\nthey agreed to them. Flora accepted a chance of liberty, money and an\\nenlarged horizon, Ralph, of course, was playing a different game. But he\\nwas in a very awkward hole financially. He seized at the chance. His debts\\nwould be paid. He could start again with a clean sheet. His was not a nature\\nto envisage the future, but I gather that he saw vaguely the engagement with\\nFlora being broken off after a decent interval had elapsed. Both Flora and\\nhe stipulated that it should be kept a secret for the present. He was anxious\\nto conceal it from Ursula. He felt instinctively that her nature, strong and\\nresolute, with an inherent distaste for duplicity, was not one to welcome\\nsuch a course.\\nThen came the crucial moment when Roger Ackroyd, always highhanded, decided to announce the engagement. He said no word of his\\nintention to Ralph—only to Flora, and Flora, apathetic, raised no objection.\\nOn Ursula, the news fell like a bombshell. Summoned by her, Ralph came\\nhurriedly down from town. They met in the wood, where part of their\\nconversation was overheard by my sister. Ralph implored her to keep silent\\nfor a little while longer, Ursula was equally determined to have done with\\nconcealments. She would tell Mr. Ackroyd the truth without any further\\ndelay. Husband and wife parted acrimoniously.\\nUrsula, steadfast in her purpose, sought an interview with Roger\\nAckroyd that very afternoon, and revealed the truth to him. Their interview\\nwas a stormy one—it might have been even more stormy had not Roger\\nAckroyd been already obsessed with his own troubles. It was bad enough,\\nhowever. Ackroyd was not the kind of man to forgive the deceit that had\\nbeen practised upon him. His rancour was mainly directed to Ralph, but\\nUrsula came in for her share, since he regarded her as a girl who had\\ndeliberately tried to “entrap” the adopted son of a very wealthy man.\\nUnforgivable things were said on both sides.\\nThat same evening Ursula met Ralph by appointment in the small\\nsummerhouse, stealing out from the house by the side door in order to do\\nso. Their interview was made up of reproaches on both sides. Ralph charged\\nUrsula with having irretrievably ruined his prospects by her ill-timed\\nrevelation. Ursula reproached Ralph with his duplicity.\\nThey parted at last. A little over half an hour later came the discovery of\\nRoger Ackroyd’s body. Since that night Ursula had neither seen nor heard\\nfrom Ralph.\\nAs the story unfolded itself, I realized more and more what a damning\\nseries of facts it was. Alive, Ackroyd could hardly have failed to alter his\\nwill—I knew him well enough to realize that to do so would be his first\\nthought. His death came in the nick of time for Ralph and Ursula Paton.\\nSmall wonder the girl had held her tongue, and played her part so\\nconsistently.\\nMy meditations were interrupted. It was Poirot’s voice speaking, and I\\nknew from the gravity of his tone that he, too, was fully alive to the\\nimplications of the position.\\n“Mademoiselle, I must ask you one question, and you must answer it\\ntruthfully, for on it everything may hang: What time was it when you parted\\nfrom Captain Ralph Paton in the summerhouse? Now, take a little minute so\\nthat your answer may be very exact.”\\nThe girl gave a half laugh, bitter enough in all conscience.\\n“Do you think I haven’t gone over that again and again in my own\\nmind? It was just half past nine when I went out to meet him. Major Blunt\\nwas walking up and down the terrace, so I had to go round through the\\nbushes to avoid him. It must have been about twenty-seven minutes to ten\\nwhen I reached the summerhouse. Ralph was waiting for me. I was with\\nhim ten minutes—not longer, for it was just a quarter to ten when I got back\\nto the house.”\\nI saw now the insistence of her question the other day. If only Ackroyd\\ncould have been proved to have been killed before a quarter to ten, and not\\nafter.\\nI saw the reflection of that thought in Poirot’s next question.\\n“Who left the summerhouse first?”\\n“I did.”\\n“Leaving Ralph Paton in the summerhouse?”\\n“Yes—but you don’t think—”\\n“Mademoiselle, it is of no importance what I think. What did you do\\nwhen you got back to the house?”\\n“I went up to my room.”\\n“And stayed there until when?”\\n“Until about ten o’clock.”\\n“Is there anyone who can prove that?”\\n“Prove? That I was in my room, you mean? Oh! no. But surely—oh! I\\nsee, they might think—they might think—”\\nI saw the dawning horror in her eyes.\\nPoirot finished the sentence for her.\\n“That it was you who entered by the window and stabbed Mr. Ackroyd\\nas he sat in his chair? Yes, they might think just that.”\\n“Nobody but a fool would think any such thing,” said Caroline\\nindignantly.\\nShe patted Ursula on the shoulder.\\nThe girl had her face hidden in her hands.\\n“Horrible,” she was murmuring. “Horrible.”\\nCaroline gave her a friendly shake.\\n“Don’t worry, my dear,” she said. “M. Poirot doesn’t think that really.\\nAs for that husband of yours, I don’t think much of him, and I tell you so\\ncandidly. Running away and leaving you to face the music.”\\nBut Ursula shook her head energetically.\\n“Oh, no,” she cried. “It wasn’t like that at all. Ralph would not run away\\non his own account. I see now. If he heard of his stepfather’s murder, he\\nmight think himself that I had done it.”\\n“He wouldn’t think any such thing,” said Caroline.\\n“I was so cruel to him that night—so hard and bitter. I wouldn’t listen to\\nwhat he was trying to say—wouldn’t believe that he really cared. I just\\nstood there telling him what I thought of him, and saying the coldest,\\ncruellest things that came into my mind—trying my best to hurt him.”\\n“Do him no harm,” said Caroline. “Never worry about what you say to\\na man. They’re so conceited that they never believe you mean it if it’s\\nunflattering.”\\nUrsula went on nervously twisting and untwisting her hands.\\n“When the murder was discovered and he didn’t come forward, I was\\nterribly upset. Just for a moment I wondered—but then I knew he couldn’t\\n—he couldn’t…But I wished he would come forward and say openly that\\nhe’d had nothing to do with it. I knew that he was fond of Dr. Sheppard, and\\nI fancied that perhaps Dr. Sheppard might know where he was hiding.”\\nShe turned to me.\\n“That’s why I said what I did to you that day. I thought, if you knew\\nwhere he was, you might pass on the message to him.”\\n“I?” I exclaimed.\\n“Why should James know where he was?” demanded Caroline sharply.\\n“It was very unlikely, I know,” admitted Ursula, “but Ralph had often\\nspoken of Dr. Sheppard, and I knew that he would be likely to consider him\\nas his best friend in King’s Abbot.”\\n“My dear child,” I said, “I have not the least idea where Ralph Paton is\\nat the present moment.”\\n“That is true enough,” said Poirot.\\n“But—” Ursula held out the newspaper cutting in a puzzled fashion.\\n“Ah! that,” said Poirot, slightly embarrassed; “a bagatelle,\\nmademoiselle. A rien du tout. Not for a moment do I believe that Ralph\\nPaton has been arrested.”\\n“But then—” began the girl slowly.\\nPoirot went on quickly:\\n“There is one thing I should like to know—did Captain Paton wear\\nshoes or boots that night?”\\nUrsula shook her head.\\n“I can’t remember.”\\n“A pity! But how should you? Now, madame,” he smiled at her, his\\nhead on one side, his forefinger wagging eloquently, “no questions. And do\\nnot torment yourself. Be of good courage, and place your faith in Hercule\\nPoirot.”\\nTwenty-three\\nPOIROT’S LITTLE REUNION\\n“And now,” said Caroline, rising, “that child is coming upstairs to lie down.\\nDon’t you worry, my dear. M. Poirot will do everything he can for you—be\\nsure of that.”\\n“I ought to go back to Fernly,” said Ursula uncertainly.\\nBut Caroline silenced her protests with a firm hand.\\n“Nonsense. You’re in my hands for the time being. You’ll stay here for\\nthe present, anyway—eh, M. Poirot?”\\n“It will be the best plan,” agreed the little Belgian. “This evening I shall\\nwant mademoiselle—I beg her pardon, madame—to attend my little\\nreunion. Nine o’clock at my house. It is most necessary that she should be\\nthere.”\\nCaroline nodded, and went with Ursula out of the room. The door shut\\nbehind them. Poirot dropped down into a chair again.\\n“So far, so good,” he said. “Things are straightening themselves out.”\\n“They’re getting to look blacker and blacker against Ralph Paton,” I\\nobserved gloomily.\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“Yes, that is so. But it was to be expected, was it not?”\\nI looked at him, slightly puzzled by the remark. He was leaning back in\\nthe chair, his eyes half closed, the tips of his fingers just touching each\\nother. Suddenly he sighed and shook his head.\\n“What is it?” I asked.\\n“It is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend\\nHastings comes over me. That is the friend of whom I spoke to you—the\\none who resides now in the Argentine. Always, when I have had a big case,\\nhe has been by my side. And he has helped me—yes, often he has helped\\nme. For he had a knack, that one, of stumbling over the truth unawares—\\nwithout noticing it himself, bien entendu. At times, he has said something\\nparticularly foolish, and behold that foolish remark has revealed the truth to\\nme! And then, too, it was his practice to keep a written record of the cases\\nthat proved interesting.”\\nI gave a slightly embarrassed cough.\\n“As far as that goes,” I began, and then stopped.\\nPoirot sat upright in his chair. His eyes sparkled.\\n“But yes? What is it that you would say?”\\n“Well, as a matter of fact, I’ve read some of Captain Hasting’s\\nnarratives, and I thought, why not try my hand at something of the same\\nkind. Seemed a pity not to—unique opportunity—probably the only time\\nI’ll be mixed up with anything of this kind.”\\nI felt myself getting hotter and hotter, and more and more incoherent, as\\nI floundered through the above speech.\\nPoirot sprang from his chair. I had a moment’s terror that he was going\\nto embrace me French fashion, but mercifully he refrained.\\n“But this is magnificent—you have then written down your impressions\\nof the case as you went along?”\\nI nodded.\\n“Epatant!” cried Poirot. “Let me see them—this instant.”\\nI was not quite prepared for such a sudden demand. I racked my brains\\nto remember certain details.\\n“I hope you won’t mind,” I stammered. “I may have been a little—er—\\npersonal now and then.”\\n“Oh! I comprehend perfectly; you have referred to me as comic—as,\\nperhaps, ridiculous now and then? It matters not at all. Hastings, he also\\nwas not always polite. Me, I have the mind above such trivialities.”\\nStill somewhat doubtful, I rummaged in the drawers of my desk and\\nproduced an untidy pile of manuscript which I handed over to him. With an\\neye on possible publication in the future, I had divided the work into\\nchapters, and the night before I had brought it up to date with an account of\\nMiss Russell’s visit. Poirot had therefore twenty chapters.\\nI left him with them.\\nI was obliged to go out to a case at some distance away, and it was past\\neight o’clock when I got back, to be greeted with a plate of hot dinner on a\\ntray, and the announcement that Poirot and my sister had supped together at\\nhalf past seven, and that the former had then gone to my workshop to finish\\nhis reading of the manuscript.\\n“I hope, James,” said my sister, “that you’ve been careful in what you\\nsay about me in it?”\\nMy jaw dropped. I had not been careful at all.\\n“Not that it matters very much,” said Caroline, reading my expression\\ncorrectly. “M. Poirot will know what to think. He understands me much\\nbetter than you do.”\\nI went into the workshop. Poirot was sitting by the window. The\\nmanuscript lay neatly piled on a chair beside him. He laid his hand on it and\\nspoke.\\n“Eh bien,” he said, “I congratulate you—on your modesty!”\\n“Oh!” I said, rather taken aback.\\n“And on your reticence,” he added.\\nI said “Oh!” again.\\n“Not so did Hastings write,” continued my friend. “On every page,\\nmany, many times was the word ‘I’. What he thought—what he did. But\\nyou—you have kept your personality in the background; only once or twice\\ndoes it obtrude—in scenes of home life, shall we say?”\\nI blushed a little before the twinkle of his eye.\\n“What do you really think of the stuff?” I asked nervously.\\n“You want my candid opinion?”\\n“Yes.”\\nPoirot laid his jesting manner aside.\\n“A very meticulous and accurate account,” he said kindly. “You have\\nrecorded all the facts faithfully and exactly—though you have shown\\nyourself becomingly reticent as to your own share in them.”\\n“And it has helped you?”\\n“Yes. I may say that it has helped me considerably. Come, we must go\\nover to my house and set the stage for my little performance.”\\nCaroline was in the hall. I think she hoped that she might be invited to\\naccompany us. Poirot dealt with the situation tactfully.\\n“I should much like to have had you present, mademoiselle,” he said\\nregretfully, “but at this juncture it would not be wise. See you, all these\\npeople tonight are suspects. Amongst them, I shall find the person who\\nkilled Mr. Ackroyd.”\\n“You really believe that?” I said incredulously.\\n“I see that you do not,” said Poirot drily. “Not yet do you appreciate\\nHercule Poirot at his true worth.”\\nAt that minute Ursula came down the staircase.\\n“You are ready, my child?” said Poirot. “That is good. We will go to my\\nhouse together. Mademoiselle Caroline, believe me, I do everything\\npossible to render you service. Good evening.”\\nWe went off, leaving Caroline rather like a dog who has been refused a\\nwalk, standing on the front door step gazing after us.\\nThe sitting room at The Larches had been got ready. On the table were\\nvarious siropes and glasses. Also a plate of biscuits. Several chairs had been\\nbrought in from the other room.\\nPoirot ran to and fro rearranging things. Pulling out a chair here,\\naltering the position of a lamp there, occasionally stooping to straighten one\\nof the mats that covered the floor. He was specially fussing over the\\nlighting. The lamps were arranged in such a way as to throw a clear light on\\nthe side of the room where the chairs were grouped, at the same time\\nleaving the other end of the room, where I presumed Poirot himself would\\nsit, in a dim twilight.\\nUrsula and I watched him. Presently a bell was heard.\\n“They arrive,” said Poirot. “Good, all is in readiness.”\\nThe door opened and the party from Fernly filed in. Poirot went forward\\nand greeted Mrs. Ackroyd and Flora.\\n“It is most good of you to come,” he said. “And Major Blunt and Mr.\\nRaymond.”\\nThe secretary was debonair as ever.\\n“What’s the great idea?” he said, laughing. “Some scientific machine?\\nDo we have bands round our wrists which register guilty heart-beats? There\\nis such an invention, isn’t there?”\\n“I have read of it, yes,” admitted Poirot. “But me, I am old-fashioned. I\\nuse the old methods. I work only with the little grey cells. Now let us begin\\n—but first I have an announcement to make to you all.”\\nHe took Ursula’s hand and drew her forward.\\n“This lady is Mrs. Ralph Paton. She was married to Captain Paton last\\nMarch.”\\nA little shriek burst from Mrs. Ackroyd.\\n“Ralph! Married! Last March! Oh! but it’s absurd. How could he be?”\\nShe stared at Ursula as though she had never seen her before.\\n“Married to Bourne?” she said. “Really, M. Poirot, I don’t believe you.”\\nUrsula flushed and began to speak, but Flora forestalled her.\\nGoing quickly to the other girl’s side, she passed her hand through her\\narm.\\n“You must not mind our being surprised,” she said. “You see, we had no\\nidea of such a thing. You and Ralph have kept your secret very well. I am—\\nvery glad about it.”\\n“You are very kind, Miss Ackroyd,” said Ursula in a low voice, “and\\nyou have every right to be exceedingly angry. Ralph behaved very badly—\\nespecially to you.”\\n“You needn’t worry about that,” said Flora, giving her arm a consoling\\nlittle pat. “Ralph was in a corner and took the only way out. I should\\nprobably have done the same in his place. I do think he might have trusted\\nme with the secret, though. I wouldn’t have let him down.”\\nPoirot rapped gently on a table and cleared his throat significantly.\\n“The board meeting’s going to begin,” said Flora. “M. Poirot hints that\\nwe mustn’t talk. But just tell me one thing. Where is Ralph? You must\\nknow if anyone does.”\\n“But I don’t,” cried Ursula, almost in a wail. “That’s just it, I don’t.”\\n“Isn’t he detained at Liverpool?” asked Raymond. “It said so in the\\npaper.”\\n“He is not at Liverpool,” said Poirot shortly.\\n“In fact,” I remarked, “no one knows where he is.”\\n“Except Hercule Poirot, eh?” said Raymond.\\nPoirot replied seriously to the other’s banter.\\n“Me, I know everything. Remember that.”\\nGeoffrey Raymond lifted his eyebrows.\\n“Everything?” He whistled. “Whew! that’s a tall order.”\\n“Do you mean to say you can really guess where Ralph Paton is\\nhiding?” I asked incredulously.\\n“You call it guessing. I call it knowing, my friend.”\\n“In Cranchester?” I hazarded.\\n“No,” replied Poirot gravely, “not in Cranchester.”\\nHe said no more, but at a gesture from him the assembled party took\\ntheir seats. As they did so, the door opened once more and two other people\\ncame in and sat down near the door. They were Parker and the housekeeper.\\n“The number is complete,” said Poirot. “Everyone is here.”\\nThere was a ring of satisfaction in his tone. And with the sound of it I\\nsaw a ripple of something like uneasiness pass over all those faces grouped\\nat the other end of the room. There was a suggestion in all this as of a trap\\n—a trap that had closed.\\nPoirot read from a list in an important manner.\\n“Mrs. Ackroyd, Miss Flora Ackroyd, Major Blunt, Mr. Geoffrey\\nRaymond, Mrs. Ralph Paton, John Parker, Elizabeth Russell.”\\nHe laid the paper down on the table.\\n“What’s the meaning of all this?” began Raymond.\\n“The list I have just read,” said Poirot, “is a list of suspected persons.\\nEvery one of you present had the opportunity to kill Mr. Ackroyd—”\\nWith a cry Mrs. Ackroyd sprang up, her throat working.\\n“I don’t like it,” she wailed. “I don’t like it. I would much prefer to go\\nhome.”\\n“You cannot go home, madame,” said Poirot sternly, “until you have\\nheard what I have to say.”\\nHe paused a moment, then cleared his throat.\\n“I will start at the beginning. When Miss Ackroyd asked me to\\ninvestigate the case, I went up to Fernly Park with the good Doctor\\nSheppard. I walked with him along the terrace, where I was shown the\\nfootprints on the windowsill. From there Inspector Raglan took me along\\nthe path which leads to the drive. My eye was caught by a little\\nsummerhouse, and I searched it thoroughly. I found two things—a scrap of\\nstarched cambric and an empty goose quill. The scrap of cambric\\nimmediately suggested to me a maid’s apron. When Inspector Raglan\\nshowed me his list of the people in the house, I noticed at once that one of\\nthe maids—Ursula Bourne, the parlourmaid—had no real alibi. According\\nto her own story, she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until ten. But\\nsupposing that instead she was in the summerhouse? If so, she must have\\ngone there to meet someone. Now we know from Dr. Sheppard that\\nsomeone from outside did come to the house that night—the stranger whom\\nhe met just by the gate. At first glance it would seem that our problem was\\nsolved, and that the stranger went to the summerhouse to meet Ursula\\nBourne. It was fairly certain that he did go to the summerhouse because of\\nthe goose quill. That suggested at once to my mind a taker of drugs—and\\none who had acquired the habit on the other side of the Atlantic where\\nsniffing ‘snow’ is more common than in this country. The man whom Dr.\\nSheppard met had an American accent, which fitted in with that\\nsupposition.\\n“But I was held up by one point. The times did not fit. Ursula Bourne\\ncould certainly not have gone to the summerhouse before nine-thirty,\\nwhereas the man must have got there by a few minutes past nine. I could, of\\ncourse, assume that he waited there for half an hour. The only alternative\\nsupposition was that there had been two separate meetings in the\\nsummerhouse that night. Eh bien, as soon as I went into that alternative I\\nfound several significant facts. I discovered that Miss Russell, the\\nhousekeeper, had visited Dr. Sheppard that morning, and had displayed a\\ngood deal of interest in cures for victims of the drug habit. Taking that in\\nconjunction with the goose quill, I assumed that the man in question came\\nto Fernly to meet the housekeeper, and not Ursula Bourne. Who, then, did\\nUrsula Bourne come to the rendezvous to meet? I was not long in doubt.\\nFirst I found a ring—a wedding ring—with ‘From R.’ and a date inside it.\\nThen I learnt that Ralph Paton had been seen coming up the path which led\\nto the summerhouse at twenty-five minutes past nine, and I also heard of a\\ncertain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the village that\\nvery afternoon—a conversation between Ralph Paton and some unknown\\ngirl. So I had my facts succeeding each other in a neat and orderly manner.\\nA secret marriage, an engagement announced on the day of the tragedy, the\\nstormy interview in the wood, and the meeting arranged for the\\nsummerhouse that night.\\n“Incidentally this proved to me one thing, that both Ralph Paton and\\nUrsula Bourne (or Paton) had the strongest motives for wishing Mr.\\nAckroyd out of the way. And it also made one other point unexpectedly\\nclear. It could not have been Ralph Paton who was with Mr. Ackroyd in the\\nstudy at nine-thirty.\\n“So we come to another and most interesting aspect of the crime. Who\\nwas it in the room with Mr. Ackroyd at nine-thirty? Not Ralph Paton, who\\nwas in the summerhouse with his wife. Not Charles Kent, who had already\\nleft. Who, then? I posed my cleverest—my most audacious question: Was\\nanyone with him?”\\nPoirot leaned forward and shot the last words triumphantly at us,\\ndrawing back afterwards with the air of one who has made a decided hit.\\nRaymond, however, did not seem impressed, and lodged a mild protest.\\n“I don’t know if you’re trying to make me out a liar, M. Poirot, but the\\nmatter does not rest on my evidence alone—except perhaps as to the exact\\nwords used. Remember, Major Blunt also heard Mr. Ackroyd talking to\\nsomeone. He was on the terrace outside, and couldn’t catch the words\\nclearly, but he distinctly heard the voices.”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“I have not forgotten,” he said quietly. “But Major Blunt was under the\\nimpression that it was you to whom Mr. Ackroyd was speaking.”\\nFor a moment Raymond seemed taken aback. Then he recovered\\nhimself.\\n“Blunt knows now that he was mistaken,” he said.\\n“Exactly,” agreed the other man.\\n“Yet there must have been some reason for his thinking so,” mused\\nPoirot. “Oh! no,” he held up his hand in protest, “I know the reason you\\nwill give—but it is not enough. We must seek elsewhere. I will put it this\\nway. From the beginning of the case I have been struck by one thing—the\\nnature of those words which Mr. Raymond overheard. It has been amazing\\nto me that no one has commented on them—has seen anything odd about\\nthem.”\\nHe paused a minute, and then quoted softly:\\n“…the calls on my purse have been so frequent of late that I fear it is\\nimpossible for me to accede to your request. Does nothing strike you as odd\\nabout that?”\\n“I don’t think so,” said Raymond. “He has frequently dictated letters to\\nme, using almost exactly those same words.”\\n“Exactly,” cried Poirot. “That is what I seek to arrive at. Would any man\\nuse such a phrase in talking to another? Impossible that that should be part\\nof a real conversation. Now, if he had been dictating a letter—”\\n“You mean he was reading a letter aloud,” said Raymond slowly. “Even\\nso, he must have been reading to someone.”\\n“But why? We have no evidence that there was anyone else in the room.\\nNo other voice but Mr. Ackroyd’s was heard, remember.”\\n“Surely a man wouldn’t read letters of that type aloud to himself—not\\nunless he was—well—going barmy.”\\n“You have all forgotten one thing,” said Poirot softly: “the stranger who\\ncalled at the house the preceding Wednesday.”\\nThey all stared at him.\\n“But yes,” said Poirot, nodding encouragingly, “on Wednesday. The\\nyoung man was not of himself important. But the firm he represented\\ninterested me very much.”\\n“The Dictaphone Company,” gasped Raymond. “I see it now. A\\ndictaphone. That’s what you think?”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd had promised to invest in a dictaphone, you remember.\\nMe, I had the curiosity to inquire of the company in question. Their reply is\\nthat Mr. Ackroyd did purchase a dictaphone from their representative. Why\\nhe concealed the matter from you, I do not know.”\\n“He must have meant to surprise me with it,” murmured Raymond. “He\\nhad quite a childish love of surprising people. Meant to keep it up his sleeve\\nfor a day or so. Probably was playing with it like a new toy. Yes, it fits in.\\nYou’re quite right—no one would use quite those words in casual\\nconversation.”\\n“It explains, too,” said Poirot, “why Major Blunt thought it was you\\nwho were in the study. Such scraps as came to him were fragments of\\ndictation, and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him.\\nHis conscious mind was occupied with something quite different—the\\nwhite figure he had caught a glimpse of. He fancied it was Miss Ackroyd.\\nReally, of course, it was Ursula Bourne’s white apron he saw as she was\\nstealing down to the summerhouse.”\\nRaymond had recovered from his first surprise.\\n“All the same,” he remarked, “this discovery of yours, brilliant though it\\nis (I’m quite sure I should never have thought of it), leaves the essential\\nposition unchanged. Mr. Ackroyd was alive at nine-thirty, since he was\\nspeaking into the dictaphone. It seems clear that the man Charles Kent was\\nreally off the premises by then. As to Ralph Paton—?”\\nHe hesitated, glancing at Ursula.\\nHer colour flared up, but she answered steadily enough.\\n“Ralph and I parted just before a quarter to ten. He never went near the\\nhouse, I am sure of that. He had no intention of doing so. The last thing on\\nearth he wanted was to face his stepfather. He would have funked it badly.”\\n“It isn’t that I doubt your story for a moment,” explained Raymond.\\n“I’ve always been quite sure Captain Paton was innocent. But one has to\\nthink of a court of law—and the questions that would be asked. He is in a\\nmost unfortunate position, but if he were to come forward—”\\nPoirot interrupted.\\n“That is your advice, yes? That he should come forward?”\\n“Certainly. If you know where he is—”\\n“I perceive that you do not believe that I do know. And yet I have told\\nyou just now that I know everything. The truth of the telephone call, of the\\nfootprints on the windowsill, of the hiding-place of Ralph Paton—”\\n“Where is he?” said Blunt sharply.\\n“Not very far away,” said Poirot, smiling.\\n“In Cranchester?” I asked.\\nPoirot turned towards me.\\n“Always you ask me that. The idea of Cranchester, it is with you an idée\\nfixe. No, he is not in Cranchester. He is—there!”\\nHe pointed a dramatic forefinger. Everyone’s head turned.\\nRalph Paton was standing in the doorway.\\nTwenty-four\\nRALPH PATON’S STORY\\nIt was a very uncomfortable minute for me. I hardly took in what happened\\nnext, but there were exclamations and cries of surprise! When I was\\nsufficiently master of myself to be able to realize what was going on, Ralph\\nPaton was standing by his wife, her hand in his, and he was smiling across\\nthe room at me.\\nPoirot, too, was smiling, and at the same time shaking an eloquent\\nfinger at me.\\n“Have I not told you at least thirty-six times that it is useless to conceal\\nthings from Hercule Poirot?” he demanded. “That in such a case he finds\\nout?”\\nHe turned to the others.\\n“One day, you remember, we held a little séance about a table—just the\\nsix of us. I accused the other five persons present of concealing something\\nfrom me. Four of them gave up their secret. Dr. Sheppard did not give up\\nhis. But all along I have had my suspicions. Dr. Sheppard went to the Three\\nBoars that night hoping to find Ralph. He did not find him there; but\\nsupposing, I said to myself, that he met him in the street on his way home?\\nDr. Sheppard was a friend of Captain Paton’s, and he had come straight\\nfrom the scene of the crime. He must know that things looked very black\\nagainst him. Perhaps he knew more than the general public did—”\\n“I did,” I said ruefully. “I suppose I might as well make a clean breast of\\nthings now. I went to see Ralph that afternoon. At first he refused to take\\nme into his confidence, but later he told me about his marriage, and the hole\\nhe was in. As soon as the murder was discovered, I realized that once the\\nfacts were known, suspicion could not fail to attach to Ralph—or, if not to\\nhim, to the girl he loved. That night I put the facts plainly before him. The\\nthought of having possibly to give evidence which might incriminate his\\nwife made him resolve at all costs to—to—”\\nI hesitated, and Ralph filled up the gap.\\n“To do a bunk,” he said graphically. “You see, Ursula left me to go back\\nto the house. I thought it possible that she might have attempted to have\\nanother interview with my stepfather. He had already been very rude to her\\nthat afternoon. It occurred to me that he might have so insulted her—in\\nsuch an unforgivable manner—that without knowing what she was doing\\n—”\\nHe stopped. Ursula released her hand from his, and stepped back.\\n“You thought that, Ralph! You actually thought that I might have done\\nit?”\\n“Let us get back to the culpable conduct of Dr. Sheppard,” said Poirot\\ndrily. “Dr. Sheppard consented to do what he could to help him. He was\\nsuccessful in hiding Captain Paton from the police.”\\n“Where?” asked Raymond. “In his own house?”\\n“Ah, no, indeed,” said Poirot. “You should ask yourself the question\\nthat I did. If the good doctor is concealing the young man, what place\\nwould he choose? It must necessarily be somewhere near at hand. I think of\\nCranchester. A hotel? No. Lodgings? Even more emphatically, no. Where,\\nthen? Ah! I have it. A nursing home. A home for the mentally unfit. I test\\nmy theory. I invent a nephew with mental trouble. I consult Mademoiselle\\nSheppard as to suitable homes. She gives me the names of two near\\nCranchester to which her brother has sent patients. I make inquiries. Yes, at\\none of them a patient was brought there by the doctor himself early on\\nSaturday morning. That patient, though known by another name, I had no\\ndifficulty in identifying as Captain Paton. After certain necessary\\nformalities, I was allowed to bring him away. He arrived at my house in the\\nearly hours of yesterday morning.”\\nI looked at him ruefully.\\n“Caroline’s Home Office expert,” I murmured. “And to think I never\\nguessed!”\\n“You see now why I drew attention to the reticence of your\\nmanuscript,” murmured Poirot. “It was strictly truthful as far as it went—\\nbut it did not go very far, eh, my friend?”\\nI was too abashed to argue.\\n“Dr. Sheppard has been very loyal,” said Ralph. “He has stood by me\\nthrough thick and thin. He did what he thought was best. I see now, from\\nwhat M. Poirot has told me, that it was not really the best. I should have\\ncome forward and faced the music. You see, in the home, we never saw a\\nnewspaper. I knew nothing of what was going on.”\\n“Dr. Sheppard has been a model of discretion,” said Poirot drily. “But\\nme, I discover all the little secrets. It is my business.”\\n“Now we can have your story of what happened that night,” said\\nRaymond impatiently.\\n“You know it already,” said Ralph. “There’s very little for me to tell. I\\nleft the summerhouse about nine forty-five, and tramped about the lanes,\\ntrying to make up my mind as to what to do next—what line to take. I’m\\nbound to admit that I’ve not the shadow of an alibi, but I give you my\\nsolemn word that I never went to the study, that I never saw my stepfather\\nalive—or dead. Whatever the world thinks, I’d like all of you to believe\\nme.”\\n“No alibi,” murmured Raymond. “That’s bad. I believe you, of course,\\nbut—it’s a bad business.”\\n“It makes things very simple, though,” said Poirot, in a cheerful voice.\\n“Very simple indeed.”\\nWe all stared at him.\\n“You see what I mean? No? Just this—to save Captain Paton the real\\ncriminal must confess.”\\nHe beamed round at us all.\\n“But yes—I mean what I say. See now, I did not invite Inspector Raglan\\nto be present. That was for a reason. I did not want to tell him all that I\\nknew—at least I did not want to tell him tonight.”\\nHe leaned forward, and suddenly his voice and his whole personality\\nchanged. He suddenly became dangerous.\\n“I who speak to you—I know the murderer of Mr. Ackroyd is in this\\nroom now. It is to the murderer I speak. Tomorrow the truth goes to\\nInspector Raglan. You understand?”\\nThere was a tense silence. Into the midst of it came the old Breton\\nwoman with a telegram on a salver. Poirot tore it open.\\nBlunt’s voice rose abrupt and resonant.\\n“The murderer is amongst us, you say? You know—which?”\\nPoirot had read the message. He crumpled it up in his hand.\\n“I know—now.”\\nHe tapped the crumpled ball of paper.\\n“What is that?” said Raymond sharply.\\n“A wireless message—from a steamer now on her way to the United\\nStates.”\\nThere was a dead silence. Poirot rose to his feet bowing.\\n“Messieurs et Mesdames, this reunion of mine is at an end. Remember\\n—the truth goes to Inspector Raglan in the morning.”\\nTwenty-five\\nTHE WHOLE TRUTH\\nA slight gesture from Poirot enjoined me to stay behind the rest. I obeyed,\\ngoing over to the fire and thoughtfully stirring the big logs on it with the toe\\nof my boot.\\nI was puzzled. For the first time I was absolutely at sea as to Poirot’s\\nmeaning. For a moment I was inclined to think that the scene I had just\\nwitnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast—that he had been what he\\ncalled “playing the comedy” with a view to making himself interesting and\\nimportant. But, in spite of myself, I was forced to believe in an underlying\\nreality. There had been real menace in his words—a certain indisputable\\nsincerity. But I still believed him to be on entirely the wrong tack.\\nWhen the door shut behind the last of the party he came over to the fire.\\n“Well, my friend,” he said quietly, “and what do you think of it all?”\\n“I don’t know what to think,” I said frankly. “What was the point? Why\\nnot go straight to Inspector Raglan with the truth instead of giving the guilty\\nperson this elaborate warning?”\\nPoirot sat down and drew out his case of tiny Russian cigarettes. He\\nsmoked for a minute or two in silence. Then:\\n“Use your little grey cells,” he said. “There is always a reason behind\\nmy actions.”\\nI hesitated for a moment, and then I said slowly:\\n“The first one that occurs to me is that you yourself do not know who\\nthe guilty person is, but that you are sure that he is to be found amongst the\\npeople here tonight. Therefore your words were intended to force a\\nconfession from the unknown murderer?”\\nPoirot nodded approvingly.\\n“A clever idea, but not the truth.”\\n“I thought, perhaps, that by making him believe you knew, you might\\nforce him out into the open—not necessarily by confession. He might try to\\nsilence you as he formerly silenced Mr. Ackroyd—before you could act\\ntomorrow morning.”\\n“A trap with myself as the bait! Merci, mon ami, but I am not\\nsufficiently heroic for that.”\\n“Then I fail to understand you. Surely you are running the risk of letting\\nthe murderer escape by thus putting him on his guard?”\\nPoirot shook his head.\\n“He cannot escape,” he said gravely. “There is only one way out—and\\nthat way does not lead to freedom.”\\n“You really believe that one of those people here tonight committed the\\nmurder?” I asked incredulously.\\n“Yes, my friend.”\\n“Which one?”\\nThere was a silence for some minutes. Then Poirot tossed the stump of\\nhis cigarette into the grate and began to speak in a quiet, reflective tone.\\n“I will take you the way that I have travelled myself. Step by step you\\nshall accompany me, and see for yourself that all the facts point\\nindisputably to one person. Now, to begin with, there were two facts and a\\nlittle discrepancy in time which especially attracted my attention. The first\\nfact was the telephone call. If Ralph Paton were indeed the murderer, the\\ntelephone call became meaningless and absurd. Therefore, I said to myself,\\nRalph Paton is not the murderer.\\n“I satisfied myself that the call could not have been sent by anyone in\\nthe house, yet I was convinced that it was amongst those present on the fatal\\nevening that I had to look for my criminal. Therefore I concluded that the\\ntelephone call must have been sent by an accomplice. I was not quite\\npleased with that deduction, but I let it stand for the minute.\\n“I next examined the motive for the call. That was difficult. I could only\\nget at it by judging its result. Which was—that the murder was discovered\\nthat night instead of—in all probability—the following morning. You agree\\nwith that?”\\n“Ye-es,” I admitted. “Yes. As you say, Mr. Ackroyd, having given\\norders that he was not to be disturbed, nobody would have been likely to go\\nto the study that night.”\\n“Très bien. The affair marches, does it not? But matters were still\\nobscure. What was the advantage of having the crime discovered that night\\nin preference to the following morning? The only idea I could get hold of\\nwas that the murderer, knowing the crime was to be discovered at a certain\\ntime, could make sure of being present when the door was broken in—or at\\nany rate immediately afterwards. And now we come to the second fact—the\\nchair pulled out from the wall. Inspector Raglan dismissed that as of no\\nimportance. I, on the contrary, have always regarded it as of supreme\\nimportance.\\n“In your manuscript you have drawn a neat little plan of the study. If\\nyou had it with you this minute you would see that—the chair being drawn\\nout in the position indicated by Parker—it would stand in a direct line\\nbetween the door and the window.”\\n“The window!” I said quickly.\\n“You, too, have my first idea. I imagined that the chair was drawn out\\nso that something connected with the window should not be seen by anyone\\nentering through the door. But I soon abandoned that supposition, for\\nthough the chair was a grandfather with a high back, it obscured very little\\nof the window—only the part between the sash and the ground. No, mon\\nami—but remember that just in front of the window there stood a table with\\nbooks and magazines upon it. Now that table was completely hidden by the\\ndrawn-out chair—and immediately I had my first shadowy suspicion of the\\ntruth.\\n“Supposing that there had been something on that table not intended to\\nbe seen? Something placed there by the murderer? As yet I had no inkling\\nof what that something might be. But I knew certain very interesting facts\\nabout it. For instance, it was something that the murderer had not been able\\nto take away with him at the time that he committed the crime. At the same\\ntime it was vital that it should be removed as soon as possible after the\\ncrime had been discovered. And so—the telephone message, and the\\nopportunity for the murderer to be on the spot when the body was\\ndiscovered.\\n“Now four people were on the scene before the police arrived. Yourself,\\nParker, Major Blunt, and Mr. Raymond. Parker I eliminated at once, since at\\nwhatever time the crime was discovered, he was the one person certain to\\nbe on the spot. Also it was he who told me of the pulled-out chair. Parker,\\nthen, was cleared (of the murder, that is. I still thought it possible that he\\nhad been blackmailing Mrs. Ferrars). Raymond and Blunt, however,\\nremained under suspicion since, if the crime had been discovered in the\\nearly hours of the morning, it was quite possible that they might have\\narrived on the scene too late to prevent the object on the round table being\\ndiscovered.\\n“Now what was that object? You heard my arguments tonight in\\nreference to the scrap of conversation overheard? As soon as I learned that a\\nrepresentative of a dictaphone company had called, the idea of a dictaphone\\ntook root in my mind. You heard what I said in this room not half an hour\\nago? They all agreed with my theory—but one vital fact seems to have\\nescaped them. Granted that a dictaphone was being used by Mr. Ackroyd\\nthat night—why was no dictaphone found?”\\n“I never thought of that,” I said.\\n“We know that a dictaphone was supplied to Mr. Ackroyd. But no\\ndictaphone has been found amongst his effects. So, if something was taken\\nfrom the table—why should not that something be the dictaphone? But\\nthere were certain difficulties in the way. The attention of everyone was, of\\ncourse, focused on the murdered man. I think anyone could have gone to\\nthe table unnoticed by the other people in the room. But a dictaphone has a\\ncertain bulk—it cannot be slipped casually into a pocket. There must have\\nbeen a receptacle of some kind capable of holding it.\\n“You see where I am arriving? The figure of the murderer is taking\\nshape. A person who was on the scene straightaway, but who might not\\nhave been if the crime had been discovered the following morning. A\\nperson carrying a receptacle into which the dictaphone might be fitted—”\\nI interrupted.\\n“But why remove the dictaphone? What was the point?”\\n“You are like Mr. Raymond. You take it for granted that what was heard\\nat nine-thirty was Mr. Ackroyd’s voice speaking into a dictaphone. But\\nconsider this useful invention for a little minute. You dictate into it, do you\\nnot? And at some later time a secretary or a typist turns it on, and the voice\\nspeaks again.”\\n“You mean—?” I gasped.\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“Yes, I meant that. At nine-thirty Mr. Ackroyd was already dead. It was\\nthe dictaphone speaking—not the man.”\\n“And the murderer switched it on. Then he must have been in the room\\nat that minute?”\\n“Possibly. But we must not exclude the likelihood of some mechanical\\ndevice having been applied—something after the nature of a time lock, or\\neven of a simple alarm clock. But in that case we must add two\\nqualifications to our imaginary portrait of the murderer. It must be someone\\nwho knew of Mr. Ackroyd’s purchase of the dictaphone and also someone\\nwith the necessary mechanical knowledge.\\n“I had got thus far in my own mind when we came to the footprints on\\nthe window ledge. Here there were three conclusions open to me. (1) They\\nmight really have been made by Ralph Paton. He had been at Fernly that\\nnight, and might have climbed into the study and found his uncle dead\\nthere. That was one hypothesis. (2) There was the possibility that the\\nfootmarks might have been made by somebody else who happened to have\\nthe same kind of studs in his shoes. But the inmates of the house had shoes\\nsoled with crêpe rubber, and I declined to believe in the coincidence of\\nsomeone from outside having the same kind of shoes as Ralph Paton wore.\\nCharles Kent, as we know from the barmaid of the Dog and Whistle, had on\\na pair of boots ‘clean dropping off him.’ (3) Those prints were made by\\nsomeone deliberately trying to throw suspicion on Ralph Paton. To test this\\nlast conclusion, it was necessary to ascertain certain facts. One pair of\\nRalph’s shoes had been obtained from the Three Boars by the police.\\nNeither Ralph nor anyone else could have worn them that evening, since\\nthey were downstairs being cleaned. According to the police theory, Ralph\\nwas wearing another pair of the same kind, and I found out that it was true\\nthat he had two pairs. Now for my theory to be proved correct it was\\nnecessary for the murderer to have worn Ralph’s shoes that evening—in\\nwhich case Ralph must have been wearing yet a third pair of footwear of\\nsome kind. I could hardly suppose that he would bring three pairs of shoes\\nall alike—the third pair of footwear were more likely to be boots. I got your\\nsister to make inquiries on this point—laying some stress on the colour, in\\norder—I admit it frankly—to obscure the real reason for my asking.\\n“You know the result of her investigations. Ralph Paton had had a pair\\nof boots with him. The first question I asked him when he came to my\\nhouse yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the fatal\\nnight. He replied at once that he had worn boots—he was still wearing\\nthem, in fact—having nothing else to put on.\\n“So we get a step further in our description of the murderer—a person\\nwho had the opportunity to take these shoes of Ralph Paton’s from the\\nThree Boars that day.”\\nHe paused, and then said, with a slightly raised voice:\\n“There is one further point. The murderer must have been a person who\\nhad the opportunity to purloin that dagger from the silver table. You might\\nargue that anyone in the house might have done so, but I will recall to you\\nthat Flora Ackroyd was very positive that the dagger was not there when\\nshe examined the silver table.”\\nHe paused again.\\n“Let us recapitulate—now that all is clear. A person who was at the\\nThree Boars earlier that day, a person who knew Ackroyd well enough to\\nknow that he had purchased a dictaphone, a person who was of a\\nmechanical turn of mind, who had the opportunity to take the dagger from\\nthe silver table before Miss Flora arrived, who had with him a receptacle\\nsuitable for hiding the dictaphone—such as a black bag—and who had the\\nstudy to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered while\\nParker was telephoning for the police. In fact—Dr. Sheppard!”\\nTwenty-six\\nAND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH\\nThere was a dead silence for a minute and a half.\\nThen I laughed.\\n“You’re mad,” I said.\\n“No,” said Poirot placidly. “I am not mad. It was the little discrepancy\\nin time that first drew my attention to you—right at the beginning.”\\n“Discrepancy in time?” I queried, puzzled.\\n“But yes. You will remember that everyone agreed—you yourself\\nincluded—that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the house—\\nless if you took the short cut to the terrace. But you left the house at ten\\nminutes to nine—both by your own statement and that of Parker, and yet it\\nwas nine o’clock when you passed through the lodge gates. It was a chilly\\nnight—not an evening a man would be inclined to dawdle; why had you\\ntaken ten minutes to do a five minutes’ walk? All along I realized that we\\nhad only your statement for it that the study window was ever fastened.\\nAckroyd asked you if you had done so—he never looked to see. Supposing,\\nthen, that the study window was unfastened? Would there be time in that ten\\nminutes for you to run round the outside of the house, change your shoes,\\nclimb in through the window, kill Ackroyd, and get to the gate by nine\\no’clock? I decided against that theory since in all probability a man as\\nnervous as Ackroyd was that night would hear you climbing in, and then\\nthere would have been a struggle. But supposing that you killed Ackroyd\\nbefore you left—as you were standing beside his chair? Then you go out of\\nthe front door, run round to the summerhouse, take Ralph Paton’s shoes out\\nof the bag you brought up with you that night, slip them on, walk through\\nthe mud in them, and leave prints on the window ledge, you climb in, lock\\nthe study door on the inside, run back to the summerhouse, change back\\ninto your own shoes, and race down to the gate. (I went through similar\\nactions the other day, when you were with Mrs. Ackroyd—it took ten\\nminutes exactly.) Then home—and an alibi—since you had timed the\\ndictaphone for half past nine.”\\n“My dear Poirot,” I said in a voice that sounded strange and forced to\\nmy own ears, “you’ve been brooding over this case too long. What on earth\\nhad I to gain by murdering Ackroyd?”\\n“Safety. It was you who blackmailed Mrs. Ferrars. Who could have had\\na better knowledge of what killed Mr. Ferrars than the doctor who was\\nattending him? When you spoke to me that first day in the garden, you\\nmentioned a legacy received about a year ago. I have been unable to\\ndiscover any trace of a legacy. You had to invent some way of accounting\\nfor Mrs. Ferrars’s twenty thousand pounds. It has not done you much good.\\nYou lost most of it in speculation—then you put the screw on too hard, and\\nMrs. Ferrars took a way out that you had not expected. If Ackroyd had\\nlearnt the truth he would have had no mercy on you—you were ruined for\\never.”\\n“And the telephone call?” I asked, trying to rally. “You have a plausible\\nexplanation of that also, I suppose?”\\n“I will confess to you that it was my greatest stumbling block when I\\nfound that a call had actually been put through to you from King’s Abbot\\nstation. I at first believed that you had simply invented the story. It was a\\nvery clever touch, that. You must have some excuse for arriving at Fernly,\\nfinding the body, and so getting the chance to remove the dictaphone on\\nwhich your alibi depended. I had a very vague notion of how it was worked\\nwhen I came to see your sister that first day and inquired as to what patients\\nyou had seen on Friday morning. I had no thought of Miss Russell in my\\nmind at that time. Her visit was a lucky coincidence, since it distracted your\\nmind from the real object of my questions. I found what I was looking for.\\nAmong your patients that morning was the steward of an American liner.\\nWho more suitable than he to be leaving for Liverpool by the train that\\nevening? And afterwards he would be on the high seas, well out of the way.\\nI noted that the Orion sailed on Saturday, and having obtained the name of\\nthe steward I sent him a wireless message asking a certain question. This is\\nhis reply you saw me receive just now.”\\nHe held out the message to me. It ran as follows:\\n“Quite correct. Dr. Sheppard asked me to leave a note at a\\npatient’s house. I was to ring him up from the station with the reply.\\nReply was ‘No answer.’”\\n“It was a clever idea,” said Poirot. “The call was genuine. Your sister saw\\nyou take it. But there was only one man’s word as to what was actually said\\n—your own!”\\nI yawned.\\n“All this,” I said, “is very interesting—but hardly in the sphere of\\npractical politics.”\\n“You think not? Remember what I said—the truth goes to Inspector\\nRaglan in the morning. But, for the sake of your good sister, I am willing to\\ngive you the chance of another way out. There might be, for instance, an\\noverdose of a sleeping draught. You comprehend me? But Captain Ralph\\nPaton must be cleared—ça va sans dire. I should suggest that you finish\\nthat very interesting manuscript of yours—but abandoning your former\\nreticence.”\\n“You seem to be very prolific of suggestions,” I remarked. “Are you\\nsure you’ve quite finished?”\\n“Now that you remind me of the fact, it is true that there is one thing\\nmore. It would be most unwise on your part to attempt to silence me as you\\nsilenced M. Ackroyd. That kind of business does not succeed against\\nHercule Poirot, you understand.”\\n“My dear Poirot,” I said, smiling a little, “whatever else I may be, I am\\nnot a fool.”\\nI rose to my feet.\\n“Well, well,” I said, with a slight yawn, “I must be off home. Thank you\\nfor a most interesting and instructive evening.”\\nPoirot also rose and bowed with his accustomed politeness as I passed\\nout of the room.\\nTwenty-seven\\nAPOLOGIA\\nFive a.m. I am very tired—but I have finished my task. My arm aches from\\nwriting.\\nA strange end to my manuscript. I meant it to be published some day as\\nthe history of one of Poirot’s failures! Odd, how things pan out.\\nAll along I’ve had a premonition of disaster, from the moment I saw\\nRalph Paton and Mrs. Ferrars with their heads together. I thought then that\\nshe was confiding in him; as it happened I was quite wrong there, but the\\nidea persisted even after I went into the study with Ackroyd that night, until\\nhe told me the truth.\\nPoor old Ackroyd. I’m always glad that I gave him a chance. I urged\\nhim to read that letter before it was too late. Or let me be honest—didn’t I\\nsubconsciously realize that with a pigheaded chap like him, it was my best\\nchance of getting him not to read it? His nervousness that night was\\ninteresting psychologically. He knew danger was close at hand. And yet he\\nnever suspected me.\\nThe dagger was an afterthought. I’d brought up a very handy little\\nweapon of my own, but when I saw the dagger lying in the silver table, it\\noccurred to me at once how much better it would be to use a weapon that\\ncouldn’t be traced to me.\\nI suppose I must have meant to murder him all along. As soon as I heard\\nof Mrs. Ferrars’s death, I felt convinced that she would have told him\\neverything before she died. When I met him and he seemed so agitated, I\\nthought that perhaps he knew the truth, but that he couldn’t bring himself to\\nbelieve it, and was going to give me the chance of refuting it.\\nSo I went home and took my precautions. If the trouble were after all\\nonly something to do with Ralph—well, no harm would have been done.\\nThe dictaphone he had given me two days ago to adjust. Something had\\ngone a little wrong with it, and I persuaded him to let me have a go at it,\\ninstead of sending it back. I did what I wanted to, and took it up with me in\\nmy bag that evening.\\nI am rather pleased with myself as a writer. What could be neater, for\\ninstance, than the following:\\n“The letters were brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was just on ten\\nminutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I hesitated with my\\nhand on the door handle, looking back and wondering if there was anything\\nI had left undone.”\\nAll true, you see. But suppose I had put a row of stars after the first\\nsentence! Would somebody then have wondered what exactly happened in\\nthat blank ten minutes?\\nWhen I looked round the room from the door, I was quite satisfied.\\nNothing had been left undone. The dictaphone was on the table by the\\nwindow, timed to go off at nine-thirty (the mechanism of that little device\\nwas rather clever—based on the principle of an alarm clock), and the\\narmchair was pulled out so as to hide it from the door.\\nI must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into Parker just\\noutside the door. I have faithfully recorded that fact.\\nThen later, when the body was discovered, and I sent Parker to\\ntelephone for the police, what a judicious use of words: “I did what little\\nhad to be done!” It was quite little—just to shove the dictaphone into my\\nbag and push back the chair against the wall in its proper place. I never\\ndreamed that Parker would have noticed that chair. Logically, he ought to\\nhave been so agog over the body as to be blind to everything else. But I\\nhadn’t reckoned with the trained servant complex.\\nI wish I could have known beforehand that Flora was going to say she’d\\nseen her uncle alive at a quarter to ten. That puzzled me more than I can\\nsay. In fact, all through the case there have been things that puzzled me\\nhopelessly. Everyone seems to have taken a hand.\\nMy greatest fear all through has been Caroline. I have fancied she might\\nguess. Curious the way she spoke that day of my “strain of weakness.”\\nWell, she will never know the truth. There is, as Poirot said, one way\\nout….\\nI can trust him. He and Inspector Raglan will manage it between them. I\\nshould not like Caroline to know. She is fond of me, and then, too, she is\\nproud…My death will be a grief to her, but grief passes….\\nWhen I have finished writing, I shall enclose this whole manuscript in\\nan envelope and address it to Poirot.\\nAnd then—what shall it be? Veronal? There would be a kind of poetic\\njustice. Not that I take any responsibility for Mrs. Ferrars’s death. It was the\\ndirect consequence of her own actions. I feel no pity for her.\\nI have no pity for myself either.\\nSo let it be Veronal.\\nBut I wish Hercule Poirot had never retired from work and come here to\\ngrow vegetable marrows.\\nThe Agatha Christie Collection\\nTHE HERCULE POIROT MYSTERIES\\nMatch your wits with the famous Belgian detective.\\nThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\\nThe Murder on the Links\\nPoirot Investigates\\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\nThe Big Four\\nThe Mystery of the Blue Train\\nPeril at End House\\nLord Edgware Dies\\nMurder on the Orient Express\\nThree Act Tragedy\\nDeath in the Clouds\\nThe A.B.C.

Her books have\\nsold more than a billion copies in English and another billion in a hundred\\nforeign languages. She is the author of eighty crime novels and short-story\\ncollections, nineteen plays, two memoirs, and six novels written under the\\nname Mary Westmacott.\\nShe first tried her hand at detective fiction while working in a hospital\\ndispensary during World War I, creating the now legendary Hercule Poirot\\nwith her debut novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles. With The Murder in\\nthe Vicarage, published in 1930, she introduced another beloved sleuth,\\nMiss Jane Marple. Additional series characters include the husband-andwife crime-fighting team of Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, private\\ninvestigator Parker Pyne, and Scotland Yard detectives Superintendent\\nBattle and Inspector Japp.\\nMany of Christie’s novels and short stories were adapted into plays,\\nfilms, and television series. The Mousetrap, her most famous play of all,\\nopened in 1952 and is the longest-running play in history. Among her bestknown film adaptations are Murder on the Orient Express (1974) and Death\\non the Nile (1978), with Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov playing Hercule\\nPoirot, respectively. On the small screen Poirot has been most memorably\\nportrayed by David Suchet, and Miss Marple by Joan Hickson and\\nsubsequently Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie.\\nChristie was first married to Archibald Christie and then to\\narchaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, whom she accompanied on expeditions to\\ncountries that would also serve as the settings for many of her novels. In\\n1971 she achieved one of Britain’s highest honors when she was made a\\nDame of the British Empire. She died in 1976 at the age of eighty-five. Her\\none hundred and twentieth anniversary was celebrated around the world in\\n2010.\\nwww.AgathaChristie.com\\nVisit www.AuthorTracker.com for exclusive information on your favorite\\nHarperCollins authors.\\nTHE AGATHA CHRISTIE COLLECTION\\nThe Man in the Brown Suit\\nThe Secret of Chimneys\\nThe Seven Dials Mystery\\nThe Mysterious Mr. Quin\\nThe Sittaford Mystery\\nParker Pyne Investigates\\nWhy Didn’t They Ask Evans?\\nMurder Is Easy\\nThe Regatta Mystery and Other Stories\\nAnd Then There Were None\\nTowards Zero\\nDeath Comes as the End\\nSparkling Cyanide\\nThe Witness for the Prosecution and\\n Other Stories\\nCrooked House\\nThree Blind Mice and Other Stories\\nThey Came to Baghdad\\nDestination Unknown\\nOrdeal by Innocence\\nDouble Sin and Other Stories\\nThe Pale Horse\\nStar over Bethlehem: Poems and\\n Holiday Stories\\nEndless Night\\nPassenger to Frankfurt\\nThe Golden Ball and Other Stories\\nThe Mousetrap and Other Plays\\nThe Harlequin Tea Set\\nThe Hercule Poirot Mysteries\\nThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\\nThe Murder on the Links\\nPoirot Investigates\\nThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\nThe Big Four\\nThe Mystery of the Blue Train\\nPeril at End House\\nLord Edgware Dies\\nMurder on the Orient Express\\nThree Act Tragedy\\nDeath in the Clouds\\nThe A.B.C.

SHEPPARD AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE\\nMrs. Ferrars died on the night of the 16th–17th September—a Thursday. I\\nwas sent for at eight o’clock on the morning of Friday the 17th. There was\\nnothing to be done. She had been dead some hours.\\nIt was just a few minutes after nine when I reached home once more. I\\nopened the front door with my latchkey, and purposely delayed a few\\nmoments in the hall, hanging up my hat and the light overcoat that I had\\ndeemed a wise precaution against the chill of an early autumn morning. To\\ntell the truth, I was considerably upset and worried. I am not going to\\npretend that at that moment I foresaw the events of the next few weeks. I\\nemphatically did not do so. But my instinct told me that there were stirring\\ntimes ahead.\\nFrom the dining room on my left there came the rattle of teacups and\\nthe short, dry cough of my sister Caroline.\\n“Is that you, James?” she called.\\nAn unnecessary question, since who else could it be?

To tell the truth, it\\nwas precisely my sister Caroline who was the cause of my few minutes’\\ndelay. The motto of the mongoose family, so Mr. Kipling tells us, is: “Go\\nand find out.” If Caroline ever adopts a crest, I should certainly suggest a\\nmongoose rampant. One might omit the first part of the motto. Caroline can\\ndo any amount of finding out by sitting placidly at home. I don’t know how\\nshe manages it, but there it is. I suspect that the servants and the tradesmen\\nconstitute her Intelligence Corps. When she goes out, it is not to gather in\\ninformation, but to spread it. At that, too, she is amazingly expert.\\nIt was really this last named trait of hers which was causing me these\\npangs of indecision. Whatever I told Caroline now concerning the demise\\nof Mrs. Ferrars would be common knowledge all over the village within the\\nspace of an hour and a half. As a professional man, I naturally aim at\\ndiscretion. Therefore I have got into the habit of continually withholding all\\ninformation possible from my sister. She usually finds out just the same, but\\nI have the moral satisfaction of knowing that I am in no way to blame.\\nMrs. Ferrars’ husband died just over a year ago, and Caroline has\\nconstantly asserted, without the least foundation for the assertion, that his\\nwife poisoned him.\\nShe scorns my invariable rejoinder that Mr. Ferrars died of acute\\ngastritis, helped on by habitual overindulgence in alcoholic beverages. The\\nsymptoms of gastritis and arsenical poisoning are not, I agree, unlike, but\\nCaroline bases her accusation on quite different lines.\\n“You’ve only got to look at her,” I have heard her say.\\nMrs. Ferrars, though not in her first youth, was a very attractive woman,\\nand her clothes, though simple, always seemed to fit her very well, but all\\nthe same, lots of women buy their clothes in Paris, and have not, on that\\naccount, necessarily poisoned their husbands.'),\n",

Why don’t you come\\nand get your breakfast?”\\n“Just coming, my dear,” I said hastily. “I’ve been hanging up my\\novercoat.”\\n“You could have hung up half a dozen overcoats in this time.”\\nShe was quite right.

I continued to eat eggs and bacon. My sister’s nose,\\nwhich is long and thin, quivered a little at the tip, as it always does when\\nshe is interested or excited over anything.\\n“Well?” she demanded.\\n“A sad business. Nothing to be done. Must have died in her sleep.”\\n“I know,” said my sister again.\\nThis time I was annoyed.\\n“You can’t know,” I snapped. “I didn’t know myself until I got there,\\nand haven’t mentioned it to a soul yet. If that girl Annie knows, she must be\\na clairvoyant.”\\n“It wasn’t Annie who told me. It was the milkman. He had it from the\\nFerrarses’ cook.”\\nAs I say, there is no need for Caroline to go out to get information. She\\nsits at home and it comes to her.\\nMy sister continued:\\n“What did she die of? Heart failure?”\\n“Didn’t the milkman tell you that?” I inquired sarcastically.\\nSarcasm is wasted on Caroline.

Don’t\\ntell me!”\\nIt is odd, when you have a secret belief of your own which you do not\\nwish to acknowledge, the voicing of it by someone else will rouse you to a\\nfury of denial.

I wasn’t going to encourage that sort of thing. She\\nwill go round the village airing her views, and everyone will think that she\\nis doing so on medical data supplied by me.

Our village, King’s Abbot, is, I imagine, very much like\\nany other village. Our big town is Cranchester, nine miles away. We have a\\nlarge railway station, a small post office, and two rival “General Stores.”\\nAble-bodied men are apt to leave the place early in life, but we are rich in\\nunmarried ladies and retired military officers. Our hobbies and recreations\\ncan be summed up in the one word, “gossip.”\\nThere are only two houses of any importance in King’s Abbot. One is\\nKing’s Paddock, left to Mrs. Ferrars by her late husband. The other, Fernly\\nPark, is owned by Roger Ackroyd. Ackroyd has always interested me by\\nbeing a man more impossibly like a country squire than any country squire\\ncould really be. He reminds one of the red-faced sportsmen who always\\nappeared early in the first act of an old-fashioned musical comedy, the\\nsetting being the village green. They usually sang a song about going up to\\nLondon. Nowadays we have revues, and the country squire has died out of\\nmusical fashion.\\nOf course, Ackroyd is not really a country squire. He is an immensely\\nsuccessful manufacturer of (I think) wagon wheels. He is a man of nearly\\nfifty years of age, rubicund of face and genial of manner. He is hand and\\nglove with the vicar, subscribes liberally to parish funds (though rumour has\\nit that he is extremely mean in personal expenditure), encourages cricket\\nmatches, Lads’ Clubs, and Disabled Soldiers’ Institutes. He is, in fact, the\\nlife and soul of our peaceful village of King’s Abbot.\\nNow when Roger Ackroyd was a lad of twenty-one, he fell in love with,\\nand married, a beautiful woman some five or six years his senior. Her name\\nwas Paton, and she was a widow with one child. The history of the marriage\\nwas short and painful.

To put it bluntly, Mrs. Ackroyd was a dipsomaniac.\\nShe succeeded in drinking herself into her grave four years after her\\nmarriage.\\nIn the years that followed, Ackroyd showed no disposition to make a\\nsecond matrimonial adventure. His wife’s child by her first marriage was\\nonly seven years old when his mother died. He is now twenty-five. Ackroyd\\nhas always regarded him as his own son, and has brought him up\\naccordingly, but he has been a wild lad and a continual source of worry and\\ntrouble to his stepfather. Nevertheless we are all very fond of Ralph Paton\\nin King’s Abbot. He is such a good-looking youngster for one thing.\\nAs I said before, we are ready enough to gossip in our village.\\nEverybody noticed from the first that Ackroyd and Mrs. Ferrars got on very\\nwell together. After her husband’s death, the intimacy became more\\nmarked. They were always seen about together, and it was freely\\nconjectured that at the end of her period of mourning, Mrs. Ferrars would\\nbecome Mrs. Roger Ackroyd. It was felt, indeed, that there was a certain\\nfitness in the thing. Roger Ackroyd’s wife had admittedly died of drink.\\nAshley Ferrars had been a drunkard for many years before his death. It was\\nonly fitting that these two victims of alcoholic excess should make up to\\neach other for all that they had previously endured at the hands of their\\nformer spouses.\\nThe Ferrars only came to live here just over a year ago, but a halo of\\ngossip has surrounded Ackroyd for many years past. All the time that Ralph\\nPaton was growing up to manhood a series of lady housekeepers presided\\nover Ackroyd’s establishment, and each in turn was regarded with lively\\nsuspicion by Caroline and her cronies. It is not too much to say that for at\\nleast fifteen years the whole village has confidently expected Ackroyd to\\nmarry one of his housekeepers.

He was clearly under\\nthe influence of some strong excitement. For a minute or two he paced up\\nand down the room, then, as Parker entered with the coffee tray, he sank\\ninto an armchair in front of the fire.\\nThe study was a comfortable apartment. Bookshelves lined one wall of\\nit. The chairs were big and covered in dark blue leather. A large desk stood\\nby the window and was covered with papers neatly docketed and filed. On a\\nround table were various magazines and sporting papers.\\n“I’ve had a return of that pain after food lately,” remarked Ackroyd\\ncalmly, as he helped himself to coffee. “You must give me some more of\\nthose tablets of yours.”\\nIt struck me that he was anxious to convey the impression that our\\nconference was a medical one. I played up accordingly.\\n“I thought as much. I brought some up with me.”\\n“Good man. Hand them over now.”\\n“They’re in my bag in the hall. I’ll get them.”\\nAckroyd arrested me.\\n“Don’t you trouble. Parker will get them. Bring in the doctor’s bag, will\\nyou, Parker?”\\n“Very good, sir.”\\nParker withdrew. As I was about to speak, Ackroyd threw up his hand.\\n“Not yet. Wait. Don’t you see I’m in such a state of nerves that I can\\nhardly contain myself?”\\nI saw that plainly enough. And I was very uneasy. All sorts of\\nforebodings assailed me.\\nAckroyd spoke again almost immediately.\\n“Make certain that window’s closed, will you,” he asked.\\nSomewhat surprised, I got up and went to it.

What’s the matter with you, Ackroyd?”\\nThe door had just closed behind Parker, or I would not have put the\\nquestion.\\nAckroyd waited just a minute before replying.\\n“I’m in hell,” he said slowly, after a minute. “No, don’t bother with\\nthose damn tablets. I only said that for Parker. Servants are so curious.\\nCome here and sit down. The door’s closed too, isn’t it?”\\n“Yes.

It was the last thing I expected.\\n“Sheppard, you attended Ashley Ferrars in his last illness, didn’t you?”\\n“Yes, I did.”\\nHe seemed to find even greater difficulty in framing his next question.\\n“Did you ever suspect—did it ever enter your head—that—well, that he\\nmight have been poisoned?”\\nI was silent for a minute or two. Then I made up my mind what to say.\\nRoger Ackroyd was not Caroline.\\n“I’ll tell you the truth,” I said. “At the time I had no suspicion whatever,\\nbut since—well, it was mere idle talk on my sister’s part that first put the\\nidea into my head. Since then I haven’t been able to get it out again. But,\\nmind you, I’ve no foundation whatever for that suspicion.”\\n“He was poisoned,” said Ackroyd.\\nHe spoke in a dull heavy voice.\\n“Who by?” I asked sharply.\\n“His wife.”\\n“How do you know that?”\\n“She told me so herself.”\\n“When?”'),\n",

Yesterday I\\ncalled upon her, pointed out that a year and three weeks had now elapsed\\nsince her husband’s death, and that there could be no further objection to\\nmaking the engagement public property.

Her\\nhatred of her brute of a husband, her growing love for me, and the—the\\ndreadful means she had taken. Poison! My God! It was murder in cold\\nblood.”\\nI saw the repulsion, the horror, in Ackroyd’s face. So Mrs. Ferrars must\\nhave seen it. Ackroyd’s is not the type of the great lover who can forgive all\\nfor love’s sake. He is fundamentally a good citizen. All that was sound and\\nwholesome and law-abiding in him must have turned from her utterly in\\nthat moment of revelation.\\n“Yes,” he went on, in a low, monotonous voice, “she confessed\\neverything.

He told me that he didn’t wish to be disturbed, and I\\nrepeated the order to Parker.”\\n“Just so, sir,” said Parker respectfully.\\n“Mr. Ackroyd was certainly alive at half past nine,” put in Raymond,\\n“for I heard his voice in here talking.”\\n“Who was he talking to?”\\n“That I don’t know. Of course, at the time I took it for granted that it\\nwas Dr. Sheppard who was with him. I wanted to ask him a question about\\nsome papers I was engaged upon, but when I heard the voices I\\nremembered that he had said he wanted to talk to Dr. Sheppard without\\nbeing disturbed, and I went away again. But now it seems that the doctor\\nhad already left?”\\nI nodded.\\n“I was at home by a quarter past nine,” I said. “I didn’t go out again\\nuntil I received the telephone call.”\\n“Who could have been with him at half past nine?” queried the\\ninspector. “It wasn’t you, Mr—er—”\\n“Major Blunt,” I said.\\n“Major Hector Blunt?” asked the inspector, a respectful tone creeping\\ninto his voice.'),\n",

Now, as I was saying, it wasn’t you with Mr.\\nAckroyd at nine-thirty this evening?”\\nBlunt shook his head.\\n“Never saw him after dinner,” he volunteered.\\nThe inspector turned once more to Raymond.\\n“You didn’t overhear any of the conversation going on, did you, sir?”\\n“I did catch just a fragment of it,” said the secretary, “and, supposing as\\nI did that it was Dr. Sheppard who was with Mr. Ackroyd, that fragment\\nstruck me as distinctly odd.

The blow was delivered by a right-handed man standing behind\\nhim, and death must have been instantaneous. By the expression on the\\ndead man’s face, I should say that the blow was quite unexpected. He may\\nhave died without knowing who his assailant was.”\\n“Butlers can creep about as soft-footed as cats,” said Inspector Davis.\\n“There’s not going to be much mystery about this crime.

I followed him.\\nInspector Raglan had just turned the corner of the house, and was\\ncoming towards us. His face looked grim and satisfied.\\n“So there you are, M. Poirot,” he said. “Well, this isn’t going to be\\nmuch of a case. I’m sorry, too. A nice enough young fellow gone wrong.”\\nPoirot’s face fell, and he spoke very mildly.\\n“I’m afraid I shall not be able to be of much aid to you, then?”\\n“Next time, perhaps,” said the inspector soothingly. “Though we don’t\\nhave murders every day in this quiet little corner of the world.”\\nPoirot’s gaze took on an admiring quality.\\n“You have been of a marvellous promptness,” he observed. “How\\nexactly did you go to work, if I may ask?”\\n“Certainly,” said the inspector. “To begin with—method. That’s what I\\nalways say—method!”\\n“Ah!” cried the other. “That, too, is my watchword. Method, order, and\\nthe little grey cells.”\\n“The cells?” said the inspector, staring.\\n“The little grey cells of the brain,” explained the Belgian.\\n“Oh, of course; well, we all use them, I suppose.”\\n“In a greater or lesser degree,” murmured Poirot. “And there are, too,'),\n",

Now, I’m a plain man—”\\n“Mrs. Raglan would not agree, I am sure, to that,” said Poirot, making\\nhim a little bow.\\nInspector Raglan, a little taken aback, bowed.\\n“You don’t understand,” he said, grinning broadly. “Lord, what a lot of\\ndifference language makes. I’m telling you how I set to work. First of all,\\nmethod. Mr. Ackroyd was last seen alive at a quarter to ten by his niece,\\nMiss Flora Ackroyd. That’s fact number one, isn’t it?”\\n“If you say so.”\\n“Well, it is. At half past ten, the doctor here says that Mr. Ackroyd had\\nbeen dead at least half an hour. You stick to that, doctor?”\\n“Certainly,” I said. “Half an hour or longer.”\\n“Very good. That gives us exactly a quarter of an hour in which the\\ncrime must have been committed.

You know that Prince\\nPaul of Mauretania—the one who’s just married a dancer?”\\n“Yes?”\\n“I saw a most intriguing paragraph about her in Society Snippets the\\nother day, hinting that she was really a Russian Grand Duchess—one of the\\nCzar’s daughters who managed to escape from the Bolsheviks. Well, it\\nseems that M. Poirot solved a baffling murder mystery that threatened to\\ninvolve them both. Prince Paul was beside himself with gratitude.”\\n“Did he give him an emerald tie pin the size of a plover’s egg?” I\\ninquired sarcastically.\\n“He didn’t mention it. Why?”\\n“Nothing,” I said. “I thought it was always done. It is in detective\\nfiction anyway. The super-detective always has his rooms littered with\\nrubies and pearls and emeralds from grateful Royal clients.”\\n“It’s very interesting to hear about these things from the inside,” said\\nmy sister complacently.\\nIt would be—to Caroline.

To do so would only\\nbe to go over the same ground again and again. By arrangement with the\\npolice, very little was allowed to come out. I gave evidence as to the cause\\nof Ackroyd’s death and the probable time. The absence of Ralph Paton was\\ncommented on by the coroner, but not unduly stressed.\\nAfterwards, Poirot and I had a few words with Inspector Raglan. The\\ninspector was very grave.\\n“It looks bad, M. Poirot,” he said. “I’m trying to judge the thing fair and\\nsquare. I’m a local man, and I’ve seen Captain Paton many times in\\nCranchester. I’m not wanting him to be the guilty one—but it’s bad\\nwhichever way you look at it. If he’s innocent, why doesn’t he come\\nforward? We’ve got evidence against him, but it’s just possible that the\\nevidence could be explained away. Then why doesn’t he give an\\nexplanation?”\\nA lot more lay behind the inspector’s words than I knew at the time.\\nRalph’s description had been wired to every port and railway station in\\nEngland. The police everywhere were on the alert. His rooms in town were\\nwatched, and any houses he had been known to be in the habit of\\nfrequenting. With such a cordon it seemed impossible that Ralph should be\\nable to evade detection. He had no luggage, and, as far as anyone knew, no\\nmoney.\\n“I can’t find anyone who saw him at the station that night,” continued\\nthe inspector. “And yet he’s well known down here, and you’d think\\nsomebody would have noticed him. There’s no news from Liverpool\\neither.”\\n“You think he went to Liverpool?” queried Poirot.\\n“Well, it’s on the cards.

That\\nmight just possibly be the point of the telephone message.”\\n“That’s an idea,” said the inspector eagerly. “Do you really think that’s\\nthe explanation of the telephone call?”\\n“My friend,” said Poirot gravely, “I do not know. But I will tell you this:\\nI believe that when we find the explanation of that telephone call we shall\\nfind the explanation of the murder.”\\n“You said something like that before, I remember,” I observed, looking\\nat him curiously.\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“I always come back to it,” he said seriously.\\n“It seems to me utterly irrelevant,” I declared.\\n“I wouldn’t say that,” demurred the inspector. “But I must confess I\\nthink Mr. Poirot here harps on it a little too much. We’ve better clues than\\nthat. The fingerprints on the dagger, for instance.”\\nPoirot became suddenly very foreign in manner, as he often did when\\nexcited over anything.\\n“M. l’Inspecteur,” he said, “beware of the blind—the blind—comment\\ndire?—the little street that has no end to it.”\\nInspector Raglan stared, but I was quicker.\\n“You mean a blind alley?” I said.\\n“That is it—the blind street that leads nowhere. So it may be with those\\nfingerprints—they may lead you nowhere.”\\n“I don’t see how that can well be,” said the police officer. “I suppose\\nyou’re hinting that they’re faked? I’ve read of such things being done,\\nthough I can’t say I’ve ever come across it in my experience. But fake or\\ntrue—they’re bound to lead somewhere.”\\nPoirot merely shrugged his shoulders, flinging out his arms wide.\\nThe inspector then showed us various enlarged photographs of the\\nfingerprints, and proceeded to become technical on the subject of loops and\\nwhorls.\\n“Come now,” he said at last, annoyed by Poirot’s detached manner,'),\n",

She must spend a considerable amount on cosmetics.\\n“Everyone’s,” repeated the inspector fussily.\\n“Including mine,” I said drily.\\n“Very well. None of them correspond. That leaves us two alternatives.\\nRalph Paton, or the mysterious stranger the doctor here tells us about. When\\nwe get hold of those two—”\\n“Much valuable time may have been lost,” broke in Poirot.\\n“I don’t quite get you, Mr. Poirot.”\\n“You have taken the prints of everyone in the house, you say,”\\nmurmured Poirot. “Is that the exact truth you are telling me there, M.\\nl’Inspecteur?”\\n“Certainly.”\\n“Without overlooking anyone?”\\n“Without overlooking anyone.”\\n“The quick or the dead?”\\nFor a moment the inspector looked bewildered at what he took to be a\\nreligious observation. Then he reacted slowly.\\n“You mean—?”\\n“The dead, M. l’Inspecteur.”\\nThe inspector still took a minute or two to understand.\\n“I am suggesting,” said Poirot placidly, “that the fingerprints on the\\ndagger handle are those of Mr. Ackroyd himself. It is an easy matter to\\nverify. His body is still available.”\\n“But why? What would be the point of it? You’re surely not suggesting\\nsuicide, Mr. Poirot?”\\n“Ah! no. My theory is that the murderer wore gloves or wrapped\\nsomething round his hand. After the blow was struck, he picked up the\\nvictim’s hand and closed it round the dagger handle.”\\n“But why?”\\nPoirot shrugged his shoulders again.\\n“To make a confusing case even more confusing.”\\n“Well,” said the inspector. “I’ll look into it.

I’ll look into it all right, but\\ndon’t you be disappointed if nothing comes of it.”\\nHe endeavoured to make his tone kindly and patronising. Poirot\\nwatched him go off. Then he turned to me with twinkling eyes.\\n“Another time,” he observed, “I must be more careful of his amour\\npropre. And now that we are left to our own devices, what do you think, my\\ngood friend, of a little reunion of the family?”\\nThe “little reunion,” as Poirot called it, took place about half an hour\\nlater.

He would throw out hints\\nand suggestions, but beyond that he would not go.\\nAs I say, up till the Monday evening, my narrative might have been that\\nof Poirot himself. I played Watson to his Sherlock. But after Monday our\\nways diverged. Poirot was busy on his own account. I got to hear of what he\\nwas doing, because in King’s Abbot you get to hear of everything, but he\\ndid not take me into his confidence beforehand. And I, too, had my own\\npreoccupations.\\nOn looking back, the thing that strikes me most is the piecemeal\\ncharacter of this period. Everyone had a hand in the elucidation of the\\nmystery. It was rather like a jig-saw puzzle to which everyone contributed\\ntheir own little piece of knowledge or discovery.

But that comes\\nlater…. To take things strictly in chronological order, I must begin with the\\nsummons from Mrs. Ackroyd.\\nShe sent for me early on Tuesday morning, and since the summons\\nsounded an urgent one, I hastened there, expecting to find her in extremis.\\nThe lady was in bed. So much did she concede to the etiquette of the\\nsituation. She gave me her bony hand, and indicated a chair drawn up to the\\nbedside.\\n“Well, Mrs. Ackroyd,” I said, “and what’s the matter with you?”\\nI spoke with that kind of spurious geniality which seems to be expected\\nof general practitioners.\\n“I’m prostrated,” said Mrs. Ackroyd in a faint voice. “Absolutely\\nprostrated.

Mrs. Ackroyd accepted the tonic. One\\nmove in the game seemed now to be concluded. Not for a moment did I\\nimagine that I had been sent for because of the shock occasioned by\\nAckroyd’s death. But Mrs. Ackroyd is totally incapable of pursuing a\\nstraightforward course on any subject. She always approaches her object by\\ntortuous means.

It quite threw me off my\\nbalance.\\n“I was sure you’d know, doctor, if anyone did. You were with M. Poirot\\nall the time, weren’t you?”\\n“I was.”\\n“Then of course you know.

That\\nchallenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his knowledge of human\\nnature. A mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the truth from Mrs. Ackroyd.\\nShe was the first to react.\\nThat afternoon when I returned from seeing my patients, Caroline told\\nme that Geoffrey Raymond had just left.\\n“Did he want to see me?” I asked, as I hung up my coat in the hall.\\nCaroline was hovering by my elbow.\\n“It was M. Poirot he wanted to see,” she said. “He’d just come from\\nThe Larches. M. Poirot was out. Mr. Raymond thought that he might be\\nhere, or that you might know where he was.”\\n“I haven’t the least idea.”\\n“I tried to make him wait,” said Caroline, “but he said he would call\\nback at The Larches in half an hour, and went away down the village. A\\ngreat pity, because M. Poirot came in practically the minute after he left.”\\n“Came in here?”\\n“No, to his own house.”\\n“How do you know?”\\n“The side window,” said Caroline briefly.\\nIt seemed to me that we had now exhausted the topic. Caroline thought\\notherwise.\\n“Aren’t you going across?”\\n“Across where?”\\n“To The Larches, of course.”\\n“My dear Caroline,” I said, “what for?”\\n“Mr. Raymond wanted to see him very particularly,” said Caroline.\\n“You might hear what it’s all about.”\\nI raised my eyebrows.\\n“Curiosity is not my besetting sin,” I remarked coldly. “I can exist\\ncomfortably without knowing exactly what my neighbours are doing and\\nthinking.”'),\n",

You’re not so honest, that’s all. You always have to pretend.”\\n“Really, Caroline,” I said, and retired into my surgery.\\nTen minutes later Caroline tapped at the door and entered. In her hand\\nshe held what seemed to be a pot of jam.\\n“I wonder, James,” she said, “if you would mind taking this pot of\\nmedlar jelly across to M. Poirot? I promised it to him. He has never tasted\\nany home-made medlar jelly.”\\n“Why can’t Annie go?” I asked coldly.\\n“She’s doing some mending. I can’t spare her.”\\nCaroline and I looked at each other.\\n“Very well,” I said, rising. “But if I take the beastly thing, I shall just\\nleave it at the door. You understand that?”\\nMy sister raised her eyebrows.\\n“Naturally,” she said. “Who suggested you should do anything else?”\\nThe honours were with Caroline.\\n“If you do happen to see M. Poirot,” she said, as I opened the front\\ndoor, “you might tell him about the boots.”\\nIt was a most subtle parting shot. I wanted dreadfully to understand the\\nenigma of the boots. When the old lady with the Breton cap opened the\\ndoor to me, I found myself asking if M. Poirot was in, quite automatically.\\nPoirot sprang up to meet me, with every appearance of pleasure.\\n“Sit down, my good friend,” he said. “The big chair? This small one?\\nThe room is not too hot, no?”\\nI thought it was stifling, but refrained from saying so. The windows\\nwere closed, and a large fire burned in the grate.\\n“The English people, they have a mania for the fresh air,” declared\\nPoirot. “The big air, it is all very well outside, where it belongs.

She said, you remember,\\nthat she found the silver table lid open and closed it down in passing.”\\n“What about her statement that she went into the drawing room to see if\\nthe flowers were fresh?”\\n“Ah! we never took that very seriously, did we, my friend?

And why?”\\n“You think she went to meet someone?”\\n“I do.”\\nPoirot nodded.\\n“So do I,” he said thoughtfully.\\nThere was a pause.\\n“By the way,” I said, “I’ve got a message for you from my sister. Ralph\\nPaton’s boots were black, not brown.”\\nI was watching him closely as I gave the message, and I fancied that I\\nsaw a momentary flicker of discomposure.

He brought me a copy of the Daily Budget, dated\\nFriday, 16th September, and showed me an article dealing with the\\nsmuggling of cocaine.

No, it’s just this,” he went on, seating\\nhimself at a wave of invitation from Poirot, “I’ve got a confession to make.”\\n“En verité?” said Poirot, with an air of polite interest.\\n“Oh, it’s of no consequence, really.

You have\\ndone well.”\\n“I’m glad I’m cleared from suspicion,” laughed Raymond. “I’ll be off\\nnow.”\\n“So that is that,” I remarked, as the door closed behind the young\\nsecretary.\\n“Yes,” agreed Poirot. “A mere bagatelle—but if he had not been in the\\nbilliard room—who knows?

The letter\\ndisappeared. Still, that, as you say, may not necessarily mean that the\\nmurderer took it.

He may have got his\\ninformation about Mr. Ferrars’s death from one of the King’s Paddock\\nservants.

After Blunt and Raymond were in the room, or\\nbefore?”\\n“I can’t remember,” I said slowly. “I think it was before—no,\\nafterwards.

When Miss Ackroyd asked me to\\ninvestigate the case, I went up to Fernly Park with the good Doctor\\nSheppard. I walked with him along the terrace, where I was shown the\\nfootprints on the windowsill. From there Inspector Raglan took me along\\nthe path which leads to the drive. My eye was caught by a little\\nsummerhouse, and I searched it thoroughly. I found two things—a scrap of\\nstarched cambric and an empty goose quill. The scrap of cambric\\nimmediately suggested to me a maid’s apron. When Inspector Raglan\\nshowed me his list of the people in the house, I noticed at once that one of\\nthe maids—Ursula Bourne, the parlourmaid—had no real alibi. According\\nto her own story, she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until ten. But\\nsupposing that instead she was in the summerhouse? If so, she must have\\ngone there to meet someone. Now we know from Dr. Sheppard that\\nsomeone from outside did come to the house that night—the stranger whom\\nhe met just by the gate. At first glance it would seem that our problem was\\nsolved, and that the stranger went to the summerhouse to meet Ursula\\nBourne. It was fairly certain that he did go to the summerhouse because of\\nthe goose quill. That suggested at once to my mind a taker of drugs—and\\none who had acquired the habit on the other side of the Atlantic where\\nsniffing ‘snow’ is more common than in this country. The man whom Dr.\\nSheppard met had an American accent, which fitted in with that\\nsupposition.\\n“But I was held up by one point. The times did not fit. Ursula Bourne\\ncould certainly not have gone to the summerhouse before nine-thirty,\\nwhereas the man must have got there by a few minutes past nine.

Ralph Paton had had a pair\\nof boots with him. The first question I asked him when he came to my\\nhouse yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the fatal\\nnight. He replied at once that he had worn boots—he was still wearing\\nthem, in fact—having nothing else to put on.\\n“So we get a step further in our description of the murderer—a person\\nwho had the opportunity to take these shoes of Ralph Paton’s from the\\nThree Boars that day.”\\nHe paused, and then said, with a slightly raised voice:\\n“There is one further point. The murderer must have been a person who\\nhad the opportunity to purloin that dagger from the silver table. You might\\nargue that anyone in the house might have done so, but I will recall to you\\nthat Flora Ackroyd was very positive that the dagger was not there when\\nshe examined the silver table.”\\nHe paused again.\\n“Let us recapitulate—now that all is clear. A person who was at the\\nThree Boars earlier that day, a person who knew Ackroyd well enough to\\nknow that he had purchased a dictaphone, a person who was of a\\nmechanical turn of mind, who had the opportunity to take the dagger from\\nthe silver table before Miss Flora arrived, who had with him a receptacle\\nsuitable for hiding the dictaphone—such as a black bag—and who had the\\nstudy to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered while\\nParker was telephoning for the police. In fact—Dr. Sheppard!”\\nTwenty-six\\nAND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH\\nThere was a dead silence for a minute and a half.\\nThen I laughed.\\n“You’re mad,” I said.\\n“No,” said Poirot placidly. “I am not mad. It was the little discrepancy\\nin time that first drew my attention to you—right at the beginning.”\\n“Discrepancy in time?” I queried, puzzled.\\n“But yes.

You will remember that everyone agreed—you yourself\\nincluded—that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the house—\\nless if you took the short cut to the terrace. But you left the house at ten\\nminutes to nine—both by your own statement and that of Parker, and yet it\\nwas nine o’clock when you passed through the lodge gates. It was a chilly\\nnight—not an evening a man would be inclined to dawdle; why had you\\ntaken ten minutes to do a five minutes’ walk? All along I realized that we\\nhad only your statement for it that the study window was ever fastened.\\nAckroyd asked you if you had done so—he never looked to see. Supposing,\\nthen, that the study window was unfastened? Would there be time in that ten\\nminutes for you to run round the outside of the house, change your shoes,\\nclimb in through the window, kill Ackroyd, and get to the gate by nine\\no’clock? I decided against that theory since in all probability a man as\\nnervous as Ackroyd was that night would hear you climbing in, and then\\nthere would have been a struggle. But supposing that you killed Ackroyd\\nbefore you left—as you were standing beside his chair? Then you go out of\\nthe front door, run round to the summerhouse, take Ralph Paton’s shoes out\\nof the bag you brought up with you that night, slip them on, walk through\\nthe mud in them, and leave prints on the window ledge, you climb in, lock\\nthe study door on the inside, run back to the summerhouse, change back\\ninto your own shoes, and race down to the gate. (I went through similar\\nactions the other day, when you were with Mrs. Ackroyd—it took ten\\nminutes exactly.) Then home—and an alibi—since you had timed the\\ndictaphone for half past nine.”\\n“My dear Poirot,” I said in a voice that sounded strange and forced to\\nmy own ears, “you’ve been brooding over this case too long.

When you spoke to me that first day in the garden, you\\nmentioned a legacy received about a year ago. I have been unable to\\ndiscover any trace of a legacy. You had to invent some way of accounting\\nfor Mrs. Ferrars’s twenty thousand pounds. It has not done you much good.\\nYou lost most of it in speculation—then you put the screw on too hard, and\\nMrs. Ferrars took a way out that you had not expected.

I at first believed that you had simply invented the story. It was a\\nvery clever touch, that.

Her books have\\nsold more than a billion copies in English and another billion in a hundred\\nforeign languages. She is the author of eighty crime novels and short-story\\ncollections, nineteen plays, two memoirs, and six novels written under the\\nname Mary Westmacott.\\nShe first tried her hand at detective fiction while working in a hospital\\ndispensary during World War I, creating the now legendary Hercule Poirot\\nwith her debut novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles. With The Murder in\\nthe Vicarage, published in 1930, she introduced another beloved sleuth,\\nMiss Jane Marple. Additional series characters include the husband-andwife crime-fighting team of Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, private\\ninvestigator Parker Pyne, and Scotland Yard detectives Superintendent\\nBattle and Inspector Japp.\\nMany of Christie’s novels and short stories were adapted into plays,\\nfilms, and television series. The Mousetrap, her most famous play of all,\\nopened in 1952 and is the longest-running play in history. Among her bestknown film adaptations are Murder on the Orient Express (1974) and Death\\non the Nile (1978), with Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov playing Hercule\\nPoirot, respectively. On the small screen Poirot has been most memorably\\nportrayed by David Suchet, and Miss Marple by Joan Hickson and\\nsubsequently Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie.\\nChristie was first married to Archibald Christie and then to\\narchaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, whom she accompanied on expeditions to\\ncountries that would also serve as the settings for many of her novels.

      "make the engagement public until her year of mourning was up. Yesterday I\n",
      "called upon her, pointed out that a year and three weeks had now elapsed\n",
      "since her husband’s death, and that there could be no further objection to\n",
      "making the engagement public property. I had noticed that she had been\n",
      "very strange in her manner for some days. Now, suddenly, without the least\n",
      "warning, she broke down completely. She—she told me everything. Her\n",
      "hatred of her brute of a husband, her growing love for me, and the—the\n",

      "have seen it. Ackroyd’s is not the type of the great lover who can forgive all\n",
      "for love’s sake. He is fundamentally a good citizen. All that was sound and\n",

      "What dear Flora needs is an older man—someone steady and reliable, and\n",

      "“My dear doctor, you know what girls are nowadays. So easily acted on\n",
      "by suggestion. You, of course, know all about hypnosis and that sort of\n",

      "young still, very well off, good health, and nothing to do but enjoy life. It’s\n",
      "absurd.”\n",
      "“Not at all. Even you must have noticed how different she has been\n",
      "looking lately. It’s been coming on for the last six months. She’s looked\n",
      "positively hag-ridden. And you have just admitted that she hasn’t been able\n",

      "Caroline shook her head.\n",

      "Unforgivable things were said on both sides.\n",
      "That same evening Ursula met Ralph by appointment in the small\n",
      "summerhouse, stealing out from the house by the side door in order to do\n",
      "so. Their interview was made up of reproaches on both sides. Ralph charged\n",
      "Ursula with having irretrievably ruined his prospects by her ill-timed\n",
      "revelation. Ursula reproached Ralph with his duplicity.\n",
      "They parted at last. A little over half an hour later came the discovery of\n",
